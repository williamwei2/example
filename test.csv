 Thanks for uploading Image:Ltsi.jpg. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a claim of fair use. However, the image is currently orphaned, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. You may add it back if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see our fair use policy).

 # Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template. 
 # On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all. 

 Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

How many more thousands of words are needed to get us to a conclusion? I don't think we'll ever get there without active mediation. One lesson we've learned is that getting a consensus among only some of the editors is useless if, at the last moment, another editor suddenly pops in and wants to start over from scratch. So for a Skype chat to be effective it would have to involve all of the active editors, editors who are spread across the globe. Rather than more words faster, could fewer words discussed more slowly succeed? That is, you putting out a question and waiting for everyone to agree to a formulation before moving on to the next point, slowly building up material with complete, explicit consensus among all active parties.

 -Marmite is not from New Zealand, it's from Great Britain. Vegemite is from Australia.  
 -As an intelligent Asian student in New Zealand, I had received resentment and hatred amongst the anti-intellectuals in New Zealand. It's true; New Zealand doesn't value intelligence like the United States [where I live now for college at UCLA].  
 -The """"Tall Poppy Syndrome"""" is also prevalent in economic circles. Wealthy people who've deserved their money for their hard work are frowned upon in New Zealand. To combat this, the government of New Zealand has an overly generous welfare system, in order to remove even small amounts of economic inequality.

 ::With that in mind, I wouldn't trust the Anglo-Saxon rune poem mention of the north star so much in place of Tiw as a god, it's been heavily Christianized (the Anglo-Saxons having been Christianized considerably earlier than the Scandinavians) and subsequently a lot of the Anglo-Saxon heathen lore we could have obtained from it seems to have been deboned. I think the name of the rune is enough for a direct connection (*tīwaz/*teiwaz) and considering that Tiw was such a major god prior to being dethroned by Woden in some way, it wouldn't be surprising if there was indeed such a connection between Tiw and the Irminsuls.

My second daughter (different mother, but also with dark brown hair), had very blonde hair as a small child, and, although it has got darker, her hair is still blonde at 9 (when exposed to strong sun, it turns very blonde, almost white).

20c7ff2871837cd8,"""WINNIPEG FOLK FESTIVAL 2005 
 by John Benson 

 We stepped foot on the campground at about 7:00am. Once we reached the end of Trailhead 1 we paused for a quick moment and looked out at what was before us. During this time, Dick took a deep breath in, smiled, and exclaimed """"Ah! Folk Fest!"""" This was my first time attending this crazy festival, and after only the first 10 seconds I knew I was in for one Hell of a memorable weekend. We had driven all night long to get here as early as possible. Who were """"we"""", you ask? Well, we were a strange mix of individuals with loose connections to one another. 

 There was, of course, me. Next, we had Dick. Dick had worked as a cook at Strawberry's before I was hired there in July 2002. Dick owned The Melvin House, which is a house notorious for its parties and its interesting blend of visitors. It was the kind of house you could just show up to at any time of day and, as long as you knew someone there and you weren't terribly annoying, you were welcome to stay for a few drinks or hit of weed. You could even stay for supper, as long as you did your fair share of the cleanup afterward. The general rule was that you respect the privacy of those who lived there, you take out what you bring in, and you respect the property. Anyone who could abide by these rules and who didn't overstay their welcome could drop by during any reasonable hour of the day and just relax with whoever else was there. This system worked better than you might think. Everyone got along, and nobody got the place into any trouble. This paved the way for some monumentally successful parties around New Year's and July 1st. 

 Also part of the Folk Fest crew that year was Bev, whom I'd worked with quite frequently at the 'berry. And, finally, there was Tedray. Tedray was by far the standout member of our group. While Dick, Bev, and myself were all within a year of each other in our early-to-mid twenties, Tedray was 50-something. He was also a Caribbean immigrant. Blacker than the dead of night. His long black hair was quickly going gray. He wore it in loose dreadlocks that hung almost to the ground. He spoke with an extremely thick reggae-type accent. He not only stood out among our group of four - he stood out among everyone at the festival. On top of it all, he was by far the most outgoing and social of us all. This was a blessing. In large part thanks to Tedray, our small group of tents became the centre of attention on Friday night. I'll get to that... 

 Getting to Folk Fest was a bit of a fluke in itself. First of all, as late as Thursday afternoon, we didn't have our tickets, which had already been paid for and were supposed to have arrived. The plan was to leave The Melvin House after Dick got off work Thursday, drive overnight and pitch our tents bright and early Friday morning before the Sun came up and scorched us. I got to The Melvin House sometime in the afternoon on Thursday and sat around in the living room chatting with a few others about the upcoming weekend. Some of them had gone previous years, and they all had positive things to say about their experiences. I was getting psyched just thinking about it. Dick showed up after not too long and asked if Paco had shown up with the tickets yet. Paco's real name is Anthony (I'm not sure why everyone calls him Paco), and he was a cook at Strawberry's. We had all given him our money for the festival and camping passes with the understanding that he would put it all on his credit card. Paco didn't plan to go that year, but for some reason it was easiest to have him buy the tickets. Maybe he had a Ticketmaster account or something. I'm not sure. Well, Paco had not shown up, and repeated calls to his cellphone had gone unanswered. Dick starts to worry. I held my cool, figuring everything would sort itself out. A few hours later, maybe around 9:00pm or so, Bev shows up at The Melvin House. """"Can anyone get ahold of Paco?"""" To relieve the tension that was quickly building up, we all sat down and passed around a few joints. It was approaching 10:00pm now, and we were dreading having to either postpone the festival by a day, or worse yet, a year. Soon enough, lights flood into the living room. Paco's white car pulls into the driveway! There is much rejoicing, although we did give him shit for not answering his cell. Nonetheless, he takes out his wallet and distributes the tickets to Bev, Dick, and myself. """"Alright, Benson, Bev, pack your shit up, we need to collect the black man, and then we're off."""" says Dick after a huge sigh of relief. 

 After organizing all of our stuff in the back of Bev's very small car we went and grabbed Tedray. We definitely could have used a bigger vehicle. Tedray and I were in the back, each having to hold at least two backpacks full of gear on our laps. Now, we had brought along a fair amount of mary jane under the assumption (the very wrong assumption) that it might"

 There is not much correct in this article: 
 * The sentence  
 """"The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix depending on N continuous real parameters cannot cross except at a manifold of N-2 dimensions. In the case of a diatomic molecule (one parameter, which describes the bond length), this means that the eigenvalues do not cross."""" 

 is wrong (take the diagonal 2x2 matrix  Diag(1,A) with eigenvalues one and A, where A is our real parameter. When changing A from zero to two we see a crossing in contradiction to the sentence (N=1).

 :Let me react here as the talk page is already closed. Actually, there is nothing personal and there is no attack in the sentence, so it could be hardly a personal attack and Destinero has actually long record of REAL personal attacks (incl. personally targeted nasty words) on Czech version of Wikipedia against me and others. His attempts to get me down are endless (unsucessfull arbitrary on cz Wikipedia, crazy letters to Jimbo Wales here, etc.). It is not true, that I had months of silence just to write this. I made lot of edits there (Czech Wikipedia) in between and I accidentally look into the article to check out the source on English Wikipedia and I did see that if Destinero is blocked on Czech version, he just continues in his edit wars here.  
 :Take it as my apology, that for example in Holand, pedophiles tries to get into the term of """"Sexual orientation"""", they establish their own political party and request their own rights. If you look on it from social-political viewpoint, there is almost no difference between situation of this party and beginning of the pro-homosexual movement in the last century. Additionally, pedophiles tries to ban zoofiles (see the pedo-Party rules) from their space, in comparison of homosexuals tried to ban pedophiles from their space (self evidently, the term """"sexual orientation""""). Reason why is that definition of what is """"sexual orientation"""" or """"preference"""" vary in time and depend on point of view and this is the core matter of the problem. THIS IS A FACT, not an attack. Some homosexuals can see that as a danger for their rights, but it is not me, who is dangerous for them, but the pedophiles - and because all this (up) is a FACT, it is still OK to speak about that. IF not, homosexual censorship takes a lead, same as Destinero promotes just his own point of view and deletes all others as wrong.  20:30"""

 == Your question at RfA == 

 Thanks for noting your concerns regarding the Phil Jones article. Unfortunately , to put the discussion in context requires a back story—a long simmering debate about the propriety of types of sources (blogs, opinion columns, news reports, science articles, and peer-reviewed science articles). I considered summarizing the positions of those with whom I am debating, but I think that's unfair, as I may get some details wrong, so, if I may, I'll briefly summarize my position on some of the issues: 
 # In science articles, peer-reviewed science articles are the gold standard. 
 # In science articles, other sources are acceptable although almost never blogs, as the usage of blogs is quite restricted, and it is not easy to image how they could be used in a pure science article). 
 # One reason for using a source other than a peer-reviewed science article is that peer-reviewed science article sometimes lapse into jargon, and other sources, such as science articles or new reports may be written in a way that is better for our audience, with the critical caveat that if a new report or science article is in dispute with a peer-reviewed science article, the peer-reviewed science article almost always wins. (Rare exceptions, such as when a non-peer-reviewed article notes an error in a peer-reviewed source, and virtually all agree that the peer-reviewed source is mistaken.) 
 # The strong preference for peer-reviewed science articles is less compelling for articles which are not squarely science articles, such as bios of scientists, and articles about the political, commercial, and other aspects related to science questions. (If such an article makes a scientific statement, then the preference for peer-reviewed science articles remains, but in other areas, we apply the ordinary rules.) 

 Sorry for that long background. 

 The Phil Jones (climatologist) article is about a scientist, not a science article. Many aspects of the dispute relate to some editors acting as if it were a science article, insisting that statements in news stories ought to be dismissed. 

 The quote in question comes from the BBC. Not all Reliable Sources are equal, but I trust that the BBC is considered one of the highest quality sources. It is my opinion that in a science article, if we had a statement from the BBC and a statement form a peer-reviewed science article, we would generally default to the peer-reviewed science article (although we might decide to include both and note the discrepancy.) However, the article in question is not a science article. I was quite unhappy that some were attempting to dismiss a quote from the BBC. In addition, part of the """"argument"""" for dismissing the quote is that some editors have personal expertise in the field, and didn't agree with the substance of the statement. Sorry, that isn't how WP works. We don't permit expert to use their personal judgment to override a quote from a scientist. We do welcome expertise - but that expertise could be used to point to relevant documents on the subject, to clarify what a scientist means when they use technical terms so that editors weighing in can make a good judgment about how to use a quote, but we don't permit experts to tell us that the scientist didn't really mean what he plainly stated. If the scientist made a mistake (and that can happen), the BBC is perfectly able to follow up with a correction, or the scientist can follow up with a correction (here is a case where a blog statement might be acceptable). 

 In short, it was my view that certain editors were attempting to suppress a quote in the BBC, simply because that quote didn't fit with their narrative. 

 Could I have done a better job making my case? Almost certainly so. I've reread much of the exchange, and I confess, a couple times, I had to pause and think about what point I was trying to make. I can only assume those I was debating may well have not fully understood my point, so that may have lead to a higher ratio of heart to light that is desirable. 

 Sorry for the length of this comment. I do not like when articles include bad sources to accomplish a POV, nor do I like when good sources are removed to meet a particular POV. This is a perfect example where WP fails our audience. A reader seeing a discussion about the issue may well come to this article, and will be puzzled to see no discussion of it. I think we can do better. """

 The kamikazes attacked military targets. In contrast, """"the main purpose of a suicide bomber is to kill as many innocent civilians as they can,"""" Hamazono says. That, he says, """"is just murder."""" 

 The same distinction is made by other survivors of the Tokkotai, or Special Attack Force, conventionally known as the kamikaze. Its survivors tick off the reasons why their goal-line stand against an American invasion was different from the blind lashing-out of suicide bombers today:

 ::Addressing some of the concerns that Covenant brought to light does not mean that I am arguing that there were no inaccuracies. Rather, the inaccuracies pointed out by C are not really on target. What should always be kept in  mind is that the film is an adaptation of a comic book. I repeat: a comic book. Not a historical text or cuneiform tablet. 
 ::That said, Covenant was concerned about the usage of the word 'August' to describe the time of year, even though Augustus, for whom the month was named wasn't even born. This is true, but the word was used to describe the date in accordance to our system of measurement for time. Calling it the month of Triglodocic in the hour of scampering would probably have left us scratching our heads in confusion. 
 ::As well, C was concerned that Xerxes was described using the term 'lord of hosts.' It should be noted that indeed Judaism was wandering around, likely lost inthe desert and the founder of Christianity had not yet been born. However, the terms used to describe divinity were not inventions of either of these religions. From Campbell's Power of Myth and Eliade and Sheed's Patterns in Comparative Religion emerge the idea that nothing is new under the sun, so far as how gods (or folk trying to impress upon others their deity) are described. That aside, keep in mind that it may have just been a literary tool to describe both Xerxes' arrogance, and the strong belief that his followers had in him. 
 ::Lastly, while I was also caought up by the film's consistent references to democracy and the like, it appears that that was a function of Miller's comic. While I am almost positive that democracy and freedom were concepts explored before in writings that do not survive to the current day, it seems unlikely that they were unknown concepts to a fellow city-state of Greece.

 Deer Island. 

 Private getaway to the Skull & Bones Society. 

 What do they do there? 

 They raise children for sex and sex alone. 

 When members of Yale's most secret of secret societies go there as a """"getaway,"""" they do not bring their girlfriends. They instead bring small keys [with skull-and-crossbone designs on them, how original] made of various metals [typically gold, sometimes platinum; mixed with stronger substances for strength, of course] taken from the teeth of dead enemies. Mostly fillings, though. 

 What do these keys unlock? 

 Locks to the various underground chambers scattered about the island. There are fifteen tombs of this type [one for each member of this year's chosen bonesmen]. 

 The girls are allowed to grow no older than fourteen years old. 

 They are abused, raped, and taught to like it from birth. They have no nationality, no recognizable country of origin. Typically they're the offspring of gullible [but clean] whores that are brought to Deer Island by clever bonesmen. The whores are killed after the childbirth [and detained on the island during the nine months leading up to it]. 

 At thirteen, the girls are allowed to bear children. Before this age, abortions are routine, one of the island's few year-round residents is an abortionist. He is well paid, and is one of the only non-bonesmen ever allowed to take place in the childsex. 

 Once the thirteen/fourteen year old girls have given birth, they are taken into what are near-exact replicas of the gas chambers at Auschwitz camp I [only crafted from ornate stonework; there are etchings on the walls of various Skull-and-Bones images, the number 322, etc.]. They're told that this will be the site of a celebration of their new child's birth. A futon in the middle of the room is where the child is fucked for the final time, before being choked until unconscious, and gassed [once the bonesman has left the chamber safely, of course]. 

 For having made mention of ANY of this, I could be killed. 

 The girls are given trust tests at age eight, before fellatio can become part of their sexual repertoire. 

 The bonesman will lay his potential cocksucker down on a cold concrete floor in the middle of a well-lit auditorium underground, and force her to lay spread-eagle. He then inserts a straight razor into her VAGINA, vertically, slowly, being careful so as to minimize any potential damage. One flinch from the girl, and the blade is pulled up through the uterus, and the girl is then disposed of [the bonesmen often HOPE for a twitch from the girl, so they can mutilate her with the razor just for fun]. If the child remains calm, the razor is removed, and she is """"rewarded"""" with the privelege of getting to suck the cock of one of the most powerful men in the world. 

 Semen must be swallowed, if fellatio is performed. If the child can't get the bonesman off, he will grab her head, and give a warning thrust, jamming his PENIS into the back of her throat. She is given a couples seconds to recover, and the quality of her blowjob must either improve, or she will get another thrust, harder this time. If a third thrust is necessary, the bonesman does not let go of her head at all, but rams it into his pelvis, until he ejaculates. The girl is often unable to breathe by the end of this, and so, the razor comes out, and the girl is finished off. This very rarely happens though, the girls are taught the proper respect by the time they reach the age of eight. 

 That's all I can share safely tonight; I'll try to post more soon. I need to make it look like I'm here doing research.

c1cb414aa4f81a8f,"""*****They do include """"candidates that have already won"""" in non-STV systems, however.  This is the """"Wasted vote effect,"""" which is probably worthy of its own article.  Waste is minimized in STV systems, and this particular aspect of waste happens to be reduced to zero.  Also, including wasted and exhausted ballots is done for some elections using computer programs.  See this countback: http://davischoicevoting.org/countback/ackerman/Vacancy%20Round.htm - The 350 ballots that went to elect James Ackerman, along with the 327 exhausted ballots, would have elected replacement Leticia Miller.  Both were from the same party.  Note that the 327 """"exhausted"""" ballots includes the wasted ballots - in this case those listing James and the other winners at the very bottom and those portions that transfered in surplus from them to end up in the exhausted pile after their candidates didn't win.  Note the total votes counted here is 677.61073, although 224.38833 become exhausted again after the initial winners are excluded and candidates start getting defeated since they don't list Leticia or her closest competitor.  Note that some systems don't allow for early exhausted ballots, and exhausted ballots are by necessity wasted. To some degree, there really isn't a meaningful distinction between wasted and exhausted ballots in STV, since STV systems can't waste a ballot by putting more than a quota's worth of votes into a particular candidate - therefore the only wasted votes left are those in the exhaust pile after quotas are filled.  It is interesting that the Australians intentionally don't count the exhausted pile when computing a replacement candidate - this has the effect of ensuring the same votes will remain wasted (and the same people unrepresented), however it also has the effect of making it more certain that the replacement candidate will resemble the original.  Note that the Australian method isn't possible in systems that allow incomplete preference listings if you wish the replacement candidate to represent a full quota - it's virtually guaranteed that at least one of the votes during the countback will exhaust itself before a new candidate is chosen, and if you're only using a quota's worth of votes (those of the original winner), you will by necessity have less than a quota.

 ***Warheit: Having never met DBerg or lived in his house, i don't know what went on. It seems to me, that you have, from what you have quoted, a justifiable criticism against what went on in his household. But let me ask you, how many Family members did this involve? How many people, currently in the FAmily, ever met DAvid Berg / lived in his household / took part in what is described? How many current FAmily members even READ what you have cited from that book - as the bulk of current members, it seems to me according to the Family's own statistics, have joined in the past 15 years (the largest influx of new membership that I am aware of was in the years falling the fall of the Soviet empire and the movement's expansion into East Europe and Russia) and/or they are second generation members who were themselves children at the time that was written - was that the early 80s? Why do you seek to discredit all of these people? If you were making a research on the Catholic Church, sure you'd have a section on the Pope, and some on the leadership, and some on the wealth held in the Vatican, and some on the abuse scandals, but you'd also have the theology, and you'd also include the fact that the majority of the millions of Catholics worldwide don't have works of art stored in their basements or move their priests from parish to parish to avoid legal charges. YEs, that's happened in the Cath church, but it's not the fault of the average member. And that's my big beef here. the majority of Fam members never met DB, never met KZ, never lived in their household, never would have dreamed of the type of activity you quote as happening. Maybe you should have a page or section about """"DAvid Berg and his household"""". But don't make out that his lifestyle was the average or norm for the Family; and certainly  don't imply that this is the way life is NOW or has been during the past 20 years.

 A  	  	 Brian: 

 You're getting erections because it turns you on to see other boys undressing, and it turns you on to show them your own penis. Many people (gay and straight) get turned on by sexuality itself, regardless of the subject. True, you may not be gay, but I wouldn't totally rule it out. You should explore in your head what really does turn you on. And like I mentioned to Ryan, above, perhaps you should consider avoiding putting yourself in that situation.

 I masturbate 3-4 times a day in private, and maybe once or twice with one or two of my friends. The thing is they only play with themselves once a day, am I normal or am I some kind of sicko? 
  	  	   
 A  	  	 Matthew: 

 Well, as you can read from the other responses, masturbating a few times daily isn't necessarily bad unless it gets in the way of other activities. Now, I assume you don't mean that you masturbate with with your friends every day also? I guess that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but at this point, masturbating 4-6 times per day may be taking time away from other activities. You are probably in the normal range, although most boys don't """"circle jerk"""" that often as they reach their late teens. If you're obsessed with masturbation, or masturbating with your friends, then perhaps you should take up a sport or hobby that will give you something else to do also.

Throughout the entire postwar period, 30% or so of Italians considered themselves communist, forming the largest single bloc, but were almost entirely shut out of national power because the other parties would form almost any alliance so long as it didn't include the PCI. When the PDS was formed, it was not for them a mere name change; many of them felt completely at sea.

 Thanks for your helpful comments in the arbitration enforcement thread. 

 That said, I was wondering if you had any advice for me about where to go from here. I trust your opinion and respect your involvement in these articles a lot, and I'm still a novice here with a lot to learn. One of the clearest messages I got from the arb enforcement thread was that when I see something that I think should be reverted, I should just revert it myself rather than expecting someone else to do it. Do you think that's acceptable for me to do at this point? I definitely don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I care a lot about beginning to contribute to these articles in productive ways. 

 I also have some other ideas of things I can do that I doubt anyone would have a problem with, like adding some references to the section on mental chronometry. If you have any other suggestions about things I can be doing to help out, I'd be interested to know. 

 I'm a little concerned that I'm going to end up inadvertently acting in a way people associate with Occam, even if it's for a completely different reason, like happened recently with my comments on Victor Chmara's page. If you notice me doing something like this, would you mind pointing it out to me? I'd hate to repeat a mistake like this completely accidentally.  

 I'm aware that I'm going to be heavily scrutinized for a while here, and I'll probably be having to walk on eggshells for a bit. Any advice on how to keep in line while still contributing to these articles would be appreciated a lot. -"

The bands articles are included in A7 under the assumption that while it may be hard to tell if one is notable, there are many which obviously and totally are not conceivably.

 === North Cyprus Page - Edit Request - Kulaksiz 5 Case Section & Economy Section === 

 Dear Alessandro 57, 

 Thank you for your recent comments on my Edit Request for North Cyprus page. It seems clear that the text that I recommended needs to by shortened, as it is 'over weight'.  

 I am more than happy to shorten it, but I am having some problem in doing so, as I am not sure what my """"target"""" number of words or size of text is. 

 I have inserted the word file which includes both my original text, and then my 'references and consensus' additional request. Please do not think I am 'work-shy', I'm definitely not. However, I thought you may want to take a look, as perhaps condensing comes much easier to you, on the basis the Wiki language of every day country pages still isn't fixed in my mind. 

 Should you have any ideas or suggestions on condensing, or should you wish to have a go at cropping it, I would be grateful. It may save a lot of toing and froing as well. 

 I appreciate any time you can spare on the matter.

 This article concerning the subject - Shane Stay - meets all criteria under Wiki's notability, including sports athlete, author, public speaker or comedian, entreaupeneur and business owner. What issues with it are needing adjustments, i.e. the citations and reference placement?  
 Can you help with this portion?  
 Thanks,

 :::I think Trypt's proposal is an improvement over the current version that has become watered-down by misinterpretation of [[WP:NAD|""""wikipedia is not a dictionary""""]. I do have remaining concerns about saying """"atheism can be...simply the absence of belief that any deities exist"""" because this endorses that def (and the other 2)  each as adequate as another. Also, by just listing the defs rather than presenting them in a context, it actually makes the paragraph MORE like a dictionary. I know stating that there actually are multiple """"definitions"""" has become unpopular here recently, but saying """"Atheism has been defined as... the simple absence of belief that any deities exist"""" would remove any endorsement from any of the defs. (Btw, such would not state that there are no other defs.) Still Trypt's proposal is better than a euphemistic opening that says competing defs are merely """"describing"""" atheism. I do foresee future editors wanting to substitute """"is"""" for """"encompasses various forms of"""",  and even attempts to merge nontheism and atheism, and I do hope others will also be prepared to resist any such proposals.

 == Anti-SIAI Singularitarians == 
 You asked on my talk page for examples of Singularitarians who have opposed the Singularity Institute. There's a hanful on the SL4 mailing list. The most noticeable is Marc Geddes, who claims to have started his own competing AI project to initiate the Singularity, but he's more known for being completely insane than anything else. Russel Wallace wrote a proposal for an alternative to Yudkowsky's Friendliness model called Domain Protection. Over the next couple of months, he became increasingly critical and wrote that implementing Collective Volition """"would be arguably worse than just blowing up the planet"""" . In another post: """"If CV is ever on the point of being implemented, I strongly recommend having fast, thorough means of suicide ready to hand [...]"""" . I'm sure there are others, with varying degrees of opposition. Last I've heard, Ben Goertzel is making his own Seed AI and doesn't think Friendliness is as important as SIAI claims, but doesn't have any opposition to SIAI's success I'm aware of. I'm sure you could find more examples by looking through the SL4 archives. And sorry in advance if I've misrepresented Wallace's or Goertzel's views here, as they may have changed recently.   """

 this is the area that has been receiving most crit on this page, when it has a very in-depth article of its own. I think that constant bickering on this page should not occur and changes should only be made on the fault page itself. I have therefore since re-organising the sections more logically, also renamed external links to see also, and put the technical problems link there, and removed any other information regarding this from the main page. I would like everyone's opinion who has criticised the constant changes on this page, before any reverting is made. I personally think its better to keep it this way as the changes have been irritating and the information on the page is not that relevant to the console page. i'm not trying to 'delete' the fact the console has incredibly poor reliability, i just feel that more important edits need to be done on this page to bring it back to brilliant and not arguing over the faults."

 == Fuck Truck == 
 You say """"please don't be so hostile"""". I'm sorry if I sound hostile. I think Wikipedia is a potentially valuable resource that is being trivialized in almost every corner by the addition of garbage. NOT: """"you are garbage"""", but """"fuck truck"""" is garbage.  

 It's interesting that you would use the word """"consensus"""" when in fact the result of the vote was """"no consensus"""". This is a fundamental problem with Wikipedia, in that the only people who CARE about articles are those who are passionately attached to trivia, so articles stand when no rational person could possibly believe in them. It's TRIVIA.  

 There's no possible way that this bus service is notable in any way, shape or form; most students of the institutions involved have never heard of it, let alone the wider audience. Be that as it may. The article was allowed to stand, stupidly. But the connection to the phrase """"fuck truck"""" has NO CURRENCY with anyone. The discussion made it clear that even among Wellesley students, almost none of them use the term. And Wikipedia is not for Wellesley students. Nor is it a repository for funny stuff that was in Rolling Stone. 

 The phrase """"fuck truck"""" illuminates NOTHING about the word """"fuck"""". It's not even the primary usage of the phrase! Admittedly, it's barely in the top twenty of things that are wrong with this article, but it is profoundly exemplary of those problems. Its inclusion is in reference only to the sniggering, would-be-transgressive trivial remarks. It doesn't illuminate any cultural trend; it doesn't say anything about college life; it doesn't say anything about the growth of language. It doesn't resonate, period. The redirect to the Senate Bus remains in place. But putting it here? It's funny. If you go to Wellesley. Period. 

 I'm not anti-""""fuck"""" (or anti-fuck for that matter); I've used the word in conversation more times than you've had hot dinners. I've even giggled over """"fuck truck"""" a few times  though not in reference to anything taking place in Cambridge or Somerville. I just want this article  and Wikipedia  to not suck so hard. Every day I look things up  important things  and they're not here. Why isn't the energy being directed there instead of jokes in """"fuck""""? Because this is the very definition of sophomoric. """"Fuck"""" is giggles, and an exaggerated sense of freedom. """"Fuck truck"""" is the kind of thing that belongs on Urban Dictionary or I Love Bacon or some such college-humor site. 

 So: keep your fucking fuck truck. But know that Wikipedia is just a little tiny bit stupider because of it. I'm not hostile, and I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.

 :Well, obviously I disagree. As a graduate of one of the insitututions served by the fuck truck I can tell you that it is a well known piece of collegiate lore. Beyond that, the term meets a conventional guideline for notability because if its inclusion in a national publication. I completely agree with you that the fuck truck is trivial, but it does seem that notability has been established (something can be notable and trivial  see wikipedia's extensive coverage of soap operas for example).  Moreover, if you read the article in question, you will see that it directly responds to your argument that the """"fuck truck"""" says nothing about college life. In fact, it says quite a bit about the experience of attending a single-sex institution such as Wellesley this day in age  the stereotypes, the inconvenience of co-ed socializing, etc. That said, if you really think the Wellesley College Senate Bus is so non notable, why don't you nominate it for deletion?   
 ::I won't nominate it because such a nomination has no chance of success. The vast portion of the population that has never heard of it and would regard its inclusion in an encyclopedia will never even see the controversy, and the only ones who care are partisans of the article. But it cheapens Wikipedia. How many other college shuttles are there in the world? Thousands? I know the University of Washington here in Seattle has one. I'm sure it has a funny nickname too  I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear that it's """"fuck truck"""". Should it be in the encyclopedia? No. But my experience has been it's almost impossible to get garbage articles out of Wikipedia because a significant percentage of Wikipedia editors prefer garbage. But more to the point of """"fuck truck""""  you can't be serious. The tragedy of Wellesley students' difficulty in procuring sex partners is possibly a matter of concern and in"

 Ah thanks for that. That book is one of the ones on my now stupidly long list of books on the subject to buy... I'm sadly lacking in information on anything much below 50-guns, with the exception of what is in Gardener's book on Napoleonic frigates. I find that website to be a good source of information to help get articles started, but yes you do come across errors occasionally (but of course that applies to everything else!) One thing about that article still seems slightly odd, where it says the French 20-gun corvette was commissioned as a 28-gun 6th rate - I know we tended to over-gun our ships compared to the French but that sounds like a rather large increase..."

c6c3b5e56b0bc766,"""War and weapons have coincided with eachother for many years, but the main flare for the development of weapons were in the medieval period.  There were any kinds of weapons, crushing weapons, swords, siege engines, cleaving weapons and ranged weapons. 

 Crushing weapons 

 A mace is the first crushing weapon that man actually fashioned, wether it is a simple club or an elaborate nobles flail it has exsisted for many centuries, this concept of weaponry has endured the sands of time and the furnace of warfare.  Flails are created first by the Danish people naming it the morning star, maces and flails can be flanged, or spiked, both of these can deliver peircing blows, also the warhammer is like a utility belt of a weapon, it can crush with one end and also grapple armor or peirce it with the spiked end making this easily one of the most versitile weapons on the medieval battlefield a nd also requires no sharpening or maintence at all  

 Swords 

 A sword, a deadly weapon on the battlefield and also a symbol of power of the noble who posseses it.  A sword took many many layers of fine thin steel and iron and often took years and years of work to create a fine sword.  A sword has long been a symbol of power and authority for many years.  It is one of the most refined weapons on the medieval battlefield.  But during the age of guns the grewat bastard swords and great swords were replaced with the thin thrusting rapiers.  A great sword is usually 5-6 feet long but with a good long hilt for two hands and a pommel that balences properly it only feels like 2-5 pounds in your hands. 

 Siege Engines 

 Siege Engines were used for attacking castles but less on the battlefields.  Siege weapons threw rocks, dead poeple to spred desieses but also flaming pots of tar.  A balittlai is a giant crossbow with a huge quarrel or bolt as ammunition, a mongel was not very accurate and didnt work when the ropes got wet, it looks like a spoon launching rocks,  a thrunchbuet is much more powerful and accurate, the counter weight for this seesaw like weapon is 80-100 times the weight of the rock being thrown for the power to tear a castle to peaces.  Also there were battering rams, covered with wet animal skins to defend the people working it, a wooden pole with a metal tip to break through doors and rocks.  Also a scaling ladder was used to climb the walls. 

 Cleaving weapons 

 Usually an axe, this was good for breaking armor and shields.  The vikings had elaborate designs on their axes to symbolize the wealth of the owner.  A broad axe and throwing axes like the franshisca are germanic throwing axes. 

 Ranged weapons 

 The Bow and Arrow easily come to mind when a topic like this comes up.  But there were also slings, staff slings and crossbows.  The sling was probably invented by acident, a neanderthal man probably didnt was to lose the rock and tied to to leather thongs and accidentally threw it and it outreached anything a human arm can do, then the next challenge was to keep the sling and let the rock fly.  This was just a loop around one finger and letting the other end go.  Also the later staff sling was invented which was even farther than the sling, it works the same way but attached to a staff for more range.  The crossbow will be the next weapon I will introduce.  It is simply put a hard wood bow in a T shape.  A crossbow string is winded with a winch.  A crossbow can easily outrange a longbow and also penetrate armor more deeply, it also can be used more easily by less experienced soldiers.  The downside is that it takes a while to load while and experienced longbowmen can get 7 arrows into the arrow before the first landed.  There were many bows the composite bow, the longbow, and the short bow, also the slef bow.  The composite bow was by far the most powerful at a record of 900 feet while the famed longbow only at 400 feet.  The """"english longbow"""" was actually made by celtic nobles.  Since a bow look a long time to make it cost a lot and was hard to get.  A noble usually rented his bows to serfs for a year to practice for war.  This then became a law to practice archery on the village green after church on Sundays."""

 :::But it is not there yet. My concern lies in the idea that we should avoid including a position, labeling it name-calling. What this does is set up an automatic bias and POV. It also means that we, as editors, are taking a position that it is name calling and it is not factually correct (and I don't know if it is name-calling or correct). And, it means that very positive, positive, and balanced commentary will be allowed, and perhaps some very carefully worded negative commentary. But very negative commentary is then excluded. This means that if a number of the most prominent atheists in the western world (or perhaps world) are united in their strong condemnation, it will not be allowed—in an encyclopedia which is supposed to capture all notable ideas.

In the first place,  and the return, as it were, to salient aspects of Carnap's 1928 conception.  Schlick (1931) thus followed Wittgenstein's own suggestion to treat them instead as representing rules for the formation of verifiable singular statements. ( is indicated only in Schlick 1936a.) A second element that began to do so soon was the recognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms to observation terms... A third element was that disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability or support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was nomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth element, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the criterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it was to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick retained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages throughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological possibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned with natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements meaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a procedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only, Carnap (1936-37) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it was nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation of disconfirmation.Many of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in 1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous criterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that were syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were reducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence statements of science. {{big|{{red|While Carnap's focus on the reduction of descriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some statements, his criterion also allowed universally quantified statements to be meaningful, provided they were syntactically and terminologically correct}}}} (1932a, §2).

Furthermore, a year later they admitted that the very same census actually counted 567,000 Turkmen (more than 400% from the previous year’s claim). The census itself was published in 1959.

b104c63f31805810,"*I think the current guideline on cite templates (neither encourage nor discourage) is sound. The problem is that many editors are not aware that this is the case, and we need to aggressively discourage the idea that citation templates are required or better than hand-written ones. On the other hand, I think citation templates have a few benefits, and we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater here; moreover, I seriously doubt that editors would unconditionally agree to even discourage citation templates, let alone ban them. This issue is more important and far-reaching than date autoformatting, and we all know how much time it took to change the status quo on that issue.Personally, I don't mind citation templates, and use them often, but would not be bothered if I couldn't use them. I think the more successful path is to strongly encourage moderation: don't provide more information than necessary, and prefer citations at the end of paragraphs rather than after ever sentence. List-defined referencing sounds and looks like a good idea, but we shouldn't try to push it as a Wikipedia-wide standard."

 I moved the """"Lincoln Mark"""" article to Lincoln Mark Series, because yes series is better. Since I am a Lincoln Lincoln enthusiast I can assure that the Mark Series was not part of the Continental. Yes until the VII generation it was called the Lincoln Continental Mark, but the Marks was a model in its own right. Merging those two pages would be like merging the Jaguar X-Type with the XJ just because they both have the letter """"X"""" in them. The Mark was Lincoln's personal luxury car from 1968 to 1998. The Continental was the flagship sedan from 1946 to 1980, then mid-level from 1981 to 2002. Of course, every car name is marketing; what I was trying to explain is that Lincoln called it the Continental Mark to make poeple think of the 1956 Continental Mark (which wasn't a Lincoln!) because that car was at the time as expensive Rolls-Royce; Lincoln thought- """"let's take that name so our new '68 coupe sounds like that ultra-luxury car from 1956. By generation VII Lincoln however decided that adding Continental as a suffix did help the prestige anymore, especially since the car was most often reffered to as just the mark; so they drop it. Let me also reassure you that the 1956 Continental Mark was not a Lincoln; at this time there was a Ford subsidary called Continental (1956-1958). If you any more questions let me know ;-}.

 For the deal, the 451 Group analyst Brian Daley (Brenon Daly) that this will not be too much for Google Apps from the role. Salesforce.com for sales staff, their sales Salesforce.com software will be prize money, while sales of Google Apps is not any good.  

 Therefore, in order to control the sales channels Salesforce.com, Google must control Salesforce.com. In fact, many analysts believe that, Google is taking action on the Salesforce.com matter of time before.  

 Currently, Salesforce.com is the market value of 8.5 billion U.S. dollars. Daley, Salesforce.com premium of 23 percent is acceptable, that is 10.5 billion U.S. dollars. For the money, Google can use cash to pay for, and the remaining hands.

Maybe, if you flesh out a story, and find some news stories about the museum, it would be notable enough for it's own article. That would be better, and then once you have demonstrated its notability link the article to the DHS page. 

 2) My edits do not constitute vandalism. Read WP:VANDALISM to find out what does. My edits were made in good faith, as I'm sure yours were. We are in a content dispute. Not a vandalism war. Please rescind the warning you gave me. I do not vandalize pages. 

 3) We need to get another comment on this. I asked you to take it to RfC or third party. If you don't know how, I'll be happy to do it. and I'll be happy to abide by any decision made by an impartial party. Will you? 

 4) Sign your posts, please. Easy to do, just type four tildes (~) after you're done.

 Not really knowing the rules on inclusion, I don't have any firm opinions on whether or not the Irgun should be included in the Resistance Movement category. Supporters of the Irgun would obviously see it as a resistance movement. Opponents, which, at the time, included the majority of the Zionist movement as a whole, probably wouldn't. Arthur Koestler, the author of Promise and Fulfilment, counted as one of the Irgun's supporters. I can't remember whether he was actually a member, but he actively worked for the Irgun. Promise and Fulfilment isn't a great source. It was published in 1949 before much of what is known today came out. Therefore it reports propaganda as fact. It is also very biased. Koestler either didn't understand all the points of view or didn't want to present them. He also was either ignorant of facts which counted for the opponents of Zionism, or against the Zionist cause, or he deliberately omitted or misrepresented them.        ←     """

The mutually exclusive events in this case are that a reputable medical author(s) will publish in a reputable medical journal AND that this publication will happen to be a refutation of a fringe medical theory which both the author(s) and the journal editors reject so completely as to give it no credence whatsoever. Ain't gonna happen any time soon. It might be different if the pro-Morgellons folks ever came up with any clinical studies or other actual evidence for their claims, but in the absence of such, what reputable journal is going to give space to refuting completely unsupported fringe theories? Professionals don't usually waste their time arguing against theories which have zero supporting evidence. That's generally not how science (or medicine) operates. The one hope we have is that the CDC will eventually complete their investigation, and issue a public statement.

 Recent additions to the article state that Alderson's married name is """"Joan Alderson-Rosazza,"""" in apparent reliance on an Australian book, Sports Around the World: History, Culture, and Practice, by John Nauright.  This is factually incorrect.  Alderson's married name was Joan Braskamp, following a socially high-profile and well-reported 1954 marriage to naval aviator Bernard Braskamp, the son of the chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Naughright's book evidently conflates the names of two different American swimmers, Jody Alderson, who won a bronze medal in the women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay at the 1952 Olympics, and Joan Rosazza, who won a silver medal in the same event at the 1956 Olympics.  Alderson and Rosazza are two completely different women, with different birth dates, birthplaces and educational histories.  I'm not sure where the confusion began, but this is not the first time these Wikipedia articles have muddled the two women and their names.  For the record, I can find no sources that Jody Alderson ever married anyone named """"Rosazza,"""" and there are numerous sources for the Alderson-Braskamp marriage.    """

 :::::::::: Respectfully, I disagree alexbrn.  Gandy is talking about this article; she is making an argument from analogy which I find a reasonable way to argue.  Gandy, the answer would be yes  if the article wanted to present a protesters' position, that abortion is bad for women because it makes them mentally ill, I would hope that the editors working on it would make clear that as a statement about reality this is a fringe viewpoint.  If the article presented a protesters' viewpoint, that God hates abortion, there is no scientific-based consensus one can point to. (although some theologians might say this is a fringe position in their world)   In this article, I was very curious how the content would work out, that was focused on protesters' positions and concerns about FRINGE.  As it turned out, scientific consensuses about GMOs (as far as they exist) are clearly stated, and the protesters' beliefs are clearly stated, too, both in language that is pretty NPOV and uncluttered. (I imagine using the word """"belief"""" in stating protesters' concerns was the result of some intense discussions)   I respect the work you all did, a lot, especially in the toxic environment that was here.

 Hi, 

 You've asked a question I never thought would arise, and it makes me worry for your sake a little  Wikipedia might be getting to you! ;) 

 The name had no meaning or signification for me at all when I concocted it (whilst intoxicated no less!)  Originally, I pronounced it  """"ZOH"""" (as in Zodiac) - loz (as in the Wizard of Oz.)  A friend later suggested that another possibility.  Take a music (or a Han) """"Solo"""", pluralize it: Soloes, and change the intial sound to a Z.  ZOH-lows, I guess I'd write that. 

 I am a rather odd fellow, as is well-known, so this is what I decided.  The first use of Xoloz by me was NOT on Wikipedia, but elsewhere.  To distinguish between this other use and my Wikipedian name, I use the """"original"""" pronunciation (The Wizard of...) for non-Wikipedian purposes, and the more recent suggestion when referring to the Wikipedian. 

 Aren't you glad you asked? ;)  My answer gives further insight into the depths of my insanity; I am proud of myself, though (and pleasantly surprised), that I managed to keep my explanation of the name this short.  My verbosity and my sesquipedialism must be both coming under control. )  Best wishes,  """

 :*CNET: Red cameras encroach on Canon, Hasselblad turf 
 :These are mostly international, non-special-interest news sources with major audiences. cnet.com has an Alexa rank of 134 globally, for example. In my opinion, these press mentions alone make the company notable. 
 * """"only passing mentions in Google Books"""": There are 248 books mentioning the company by the full name. Search. That's a significant number. True, no book has been written about the company as it seems, but it's quite young so that isn't surprising.  
 Generally, RED is one of four major digital camera manufacturers used in cinema today (the other ones are Arri, Sony and, to some extent, Canon). Movies such as The Social Network or The Hobbit were shot on RED cameras (more). I don't see why this isn't notable. — ✈ () """

 == Third String Quartet == 

 Under """"Style"""" the article at this writing says this quartet in its third movement uses as a theme a pan-Slavic song, """"Hey Slavs,"""" which was banned by the Austrian authorities. But as mentioned in footnotes there, the quartet does not have a publication nor premiere shown in Burghauser. If so it seems it was not yet defying the Emperor. Of the fourteen quartets, no. 3 is one of those (2,3,4, snd 6) without a current WP article. So it seems to have attracted little attention. Czech nationalism was much more notably expressed in some choral works, for example. So the description of this quartet seems to over-emphasize any defiant effect. After possible discussion I propose to revise accordingly.    """

 Prior to being on PBS in the US, Monty Python's was sold to the public broadcaster CBC in Canada.  I recall as do others on the net(  ) seeing episodes in the summer of 1970 or 1971 initially on Saturday evenings during the summer then later on (after the CBC became uneasy with the shows' content) it was shown well after the evening news.  Eventually the CBC canceled showing the series in 1972 (  ) resulting in street protests that Eric Idle mentions in an interview many years later (  ).  The first Americans (in the U.S.) therefore to see it broadcast were those living close enough to the Canada-US border to receive one of the first CBC transmissions.   

 I also recall one of the cast members (some years after the breakup) joking in an (TV?) interview that Canada and India were the first to buy the show outside the UK which was much appreciated though apparently the Indians were disappointed at not seeing any circus acts."
