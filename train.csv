You were definitely removing sourced information w/o sufficient reasoning.

 Your links at Fatal Frame 

I saw your request for help at Help talk:Page history and came here to see what the problem was.

The Wikipedia rules on external links are much stricter than many editors realise. In particular, most links to blog sites are not allowed. The automated program  has been taught to check all edits made by new users which add links. One of its rules is that if the site name contains the word """"blogspot"""" then the edit should be rejected. 99% of the time this works well, helping new users to learn the rules.
Once you had been warned by XLinkbot, it was not helpful for you to continue trying to add the link. This can eventually be seen as disruptive; hence the warning that included the word """"vandalism"""". The term is used at Wikipedia to include various types of disruptive behaviour, as described here.

Let's move forwards! I think your best bet would be to post to the article talk page, Talk:Fatal Frame, asking whether the link is an appropriate one for the article.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Career:
1. Trapper (sub heading under career)
His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.
His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)
The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)
His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks. (Smith, 42)

2. Early Conservation Work (sub heading under career) This is my section for the project. 

From the section on his life as a trapper, we will discuss the impact of Anahareo on his switch from trapper to Conservationist.  
The transformation of his own personal views of conservationism will be explored through his writings in Pilgrims of the wild.
His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book “The Men of the Last Frontier” which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.

3. Conservation Work with Parks Board Canada (sub heading under Career)
Source matter in this subheading will discuss Grey Owl’s beginning with Parks Board Canada through meeting James Harkin, covering material surrounding the films he made with their support, and his placement as caretaker of park animals at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.  
His relationship with W. J. Oliver regarding his being commissioned by Parks Board Canada to make films of Grey Owl will also be explored.  
We will also delve further into his later life as a conservationist and his role in Prince Albert National park.

Smith, Donald B. From the Land of Shadows: the Making of Grey Owl. Saskatoon: Western Prairie Books, 1990.
[edit]Conservationist Views (new heading)
His outlook on conservationism will be explored, using both Tina Loo’s “States of Nature” Conserving Canada’s Wildlife in the Twentieth Century, and Donald Smith’s “From the Land of Shadows,” and Grey Owl’s “Pilgrims of the Wild” as sources which deal with his mindset of conservationism in detail.

4. Conservation Legacy (sub heading under Posthumous recognition)
The inspiration his lectures, books and films had on the people who came into contact with them will be explored deeper by using the sources below, as this is an area of his life which is largely overshadowed by the controversy of his false indigenous identity.

Billinghurst, Jane. Grey Owl: The Many Faces of Archie Belaney. Vancouver: Greystone Books, 1999.

GVnayR is a very """"dangerous"""" Wikipedian, I can deepen it. I'm editing Wikipedia since 2010 and I can say that he is the lamest, weirdest, most """"dangerous"""", etc. In my opinion being blocked indefinitely because of this is not fair (1~2 months is more fair). Sadly, blocking this user Hydao (who always fought against vandalism and addition of nonsense things) will not solve the problem. Sooner, the user GVnayR will start adding completely stupid and nonsense things on Wikipedia, which is unacceptable. I will continue fighting against vandalism and nonsense stuff (added by losers/nolifers like GVnayR), with or without """"Hydao"""". Now you are thinking: """"Hydao, you are insulting a user by calling """"loser and no-lifer"""", but that's not an insult, it's just the reality. A high-functioning autistic who doesn't work, doesn't have a job, doesn't have friends, use the government pension to buy PlayStation games and pay the Internet bill, someone who spend his days/months/years doing NOTHING useful (except making frequently STUPID edits on Wikipedia and wasting other ppl PRECIOUS time...) is a big loser who needs a LIFE LESSON. I don't mind if this """"Hydao"""" is blocked, the only thing I know is that GVnayR needs an """"ULTIMATE LESSON"""". Well, at least I can say that Hydao """"died"""" or is """"dying"""" for a decent/noble cause.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty. You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as """"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' There’s a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qworty’s comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedia’s internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.""""

Those aren't my words, regarding you. They are Salon's. THEY have identified you as an apoplectic, vengeful disgrace, with an unhealthy scatological fixation. So, that's what we're dealing with here: you, Qworty, as the star of an article entitled """"Wikipedia's Shame.""""

Now, Wikipedia requires that we assume good faith in our fellow editors, which I do, until the most extreme (and frankly comical) evidence points out that we're dealing with someone like you. Since we know that you will do everything within your power to sabotage any entry remotely related to Filipacchi, it's a waste of time to discuss matters of policy with you.

Even though, when that proved to be false (okay, a lie), she didn't apologize, but instead came here to support your - Qworty's - frivolous snark. Despite all of this, I've given her the benefit of the doubt. Now shall we get back to the tedious matter of editing this article?

Others have reinstated my close twice now, which I'm perfectly fine with.  I'm more than willing to defend the close if need be.  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought.  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert.  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.  If I read the comments and thought a consensus might be reached one way or another, I wouldn't have closed it.  But it is clear that no consensus exists and that the proper venue is the RfC where wider input can be obtained.-'''' Poppa Balloon'' """,0,0,0,0,0,0

8c95ef06a4e49f96,"""My behavior, certainly as a newcomer to Wikipedia has never been destructive, nor am I a vandal. I am a veteran journalist, writer, and editor with many years of experience. Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing """"edit warring"""" which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and """"revert warriors"""" who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the """"one-way"""" pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being """"disruptive"""" in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while """"revert warring"""" without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as """"proof"""" of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several """"reverts"""" on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to """"revert war"""" - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been """"revert warring"""" for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and """"reverters"""" who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the """"complaints"""" about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to """"use"""" him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.

Please take more care in the future. -  

Lazy editing is removing factual information which you could have sourced in 3 seconds work. I'd say content is considerably more important than formatting a citation prettily. Derex 
 Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the work of others, and be a little more careful next time. -  

Excuse me, but I spent 3 seconds finding a source for that, including reading the google synopsis of the very top hit. Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit. If you continue to undo the improvement of source citations that I am doing, the you and I are going to have a big problem. -",0,0,0,0,0,0

He adds that the palette is limited to a few dull colours and that an analysis of the chemical composition of the pigments in these paintings, such as white lead, shows that the pigments used in the paintings are typical of those that would have been used in the 16th century.

I should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are, I think, less likely to go to Mass wearing pants than without a veil, and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil.

 Third Opinion

Personally, I do not see any reason to reference the IQ of John Morgan in the article. I also do not believe it falls under what is allowed by Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons, as it is apparently controversial (based on discussions going on at this moment). Moreover, Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons states """"We must get the article right.[1] Be very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives. Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material — whether negative, positive, or just highly questionable — about living persons should be removed immediately and without discussion from Wikipedia articles,[2] talk pages, user pages, and project space.""""I believe what is said about IQ here is questionable at best, as it also appears that there is no solid confirmation as to what exactly his IQ is.

A music sample maybe?
""""One Thing"""" is an upbeat, uptempo, pop rock number which is... -> """"One Thing"""" is an uptempo pop rock song with a length of three minutes and ten seconds. 
The comparisons to """"What Makes You Beautiful"""" and """"I Want It That Way"""" could be used as the last sentence of the Composition section as follows -> Musically, """"One Thing"""" has been likened to """"What Makes You Beautiful"""" and the Backstreet Boys' """"I Want It That Way"""" (1999).
""""The"""" is used too much as an introduction to sentences.
""""alongside the bridge, is backed by wordless chants"""" -> alongside the bridge, and is backed by wordless chants.
""""Its instrumentation includes"""" -> This sentence will fit better as the second sentence of this section.
""""Due to"""" is a word to avoid.
""""number"""" -> song/track
""""Brian Mansfield from USA Today thought the song's..."""" -> felt that the song's
""""Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, complimented"""" -> replace """"gave"""" with """"awarded"""" and the sentence is very deconstructive and redundant, rather quote a sentence or two from the review.
""""while Entertainment Weekly writer"""" -> avoid the word """"while"""" as much as possible.

Commercial performance
""""from the parent album"""" -> from its parent album.
""""When """"One Thing"""" and """"What Makes You Beautiful"""" ..."""" -> One Direction became the second act of 2012 to have two singles simultaneously occupying the chart's top ten when """"One Thing"""" was at number six and """"What Makes You Beautiful"""" at number ten for the chart week ending 22 April 2012.

Music video
This section is extremely brief. More info to what happens in the video, its synopsis and reception?

 2 = Germany
 3 = England

 My name Is Martin Charles François Bélanger... Family Archive bearer... 

I am a direct descendant of the Bélanger Family knights that came to Canada From the family castle in France. The """" Chevaliers De Belle Angers """" I.E. (knights of beautiful angels), from the """"Chateau D'Anger"""" next to the town of """"Anger"""" in Normandie of France. Our Ancestors are recorded to have been """"Gaulois"""" since 300 years before Christ... meaning Gaelic... and YES, Gaelic France is the same as in England... and it is the origin language of French... (RECORDED FACT OF HISTORY).

 The Familly from Germany that is related to the Belanger Family and not Bélanger

family, was actually the ancient family of Ingers. This Family also had many dealings, commerce and mixing of families between the Bélanger and Belanger family. This produces Belle Ingers... Belingers, Berengers, and more... Ingers also had a great meaning to the name and you may want to look it up. (Proven to be found in the original family archives.)

 The Bélanger Family also went to Nottingham England in the service of the King to help in the holly Crusades. The name then was pronounced Belanger, and made quite the mix in the family tree. (Found in the original family archives.)

  There is quite the extensive research done in exactly what happened in our family.  For more information on the real origins of the real Bélanger Family... Look for...

The """" Chateau d'Anger """" in Normandie, France... and look into the

Family of """" Ingers """" in Germany. Both families pre-date the roman invasion of Europe.

 Skepticism regarding the existence of ISIS 

Hi there.  Perhaps I'm behind the times though I do try to keep up with the """"news"""" and with """"global"""" events, but, I get the feeling that ISIS does not really exist.  Just as there is an excellent chance that Al-Qaeda does not really exist.  I was especially inspired to post this comment when I saw in the first paragraph of this article use the neologism """"jihadist"""".  It doesn't take much brain power to know that there is no one in the world, besides maybe a few deeply stupid solo acts who keep up with thew western media, who refer to themselves as """"jihadists"""".  That is a habit of english speaking people to combine two words from different languages -in this case, arabic and english.  Similarly, there is no centralized organization known as the Taliban, no organization or action known as """"Islamist"""" no organization known as al-Qaeda.  Notice also, that even the purported mission of """"ISIS"""" is not Islamic in its nature.  I know what folks want to ask: then how is it that words like jihadist, islamist, taliban, al-qaeda, and ISIS exist?  Its called orientailsim.  The Palestinian scholar Edward Said wrote extensively on the history of english speaking people, and other imperialists, who purposely attack and misrepresent Muslim peoples.  It started with the Crusades.  I don't mean to be a no it all, but ought we just believe what we are told?  Is there a way to find empirical evidence that they do exist?  If they do exist -what are we talking about?  A few people who never studied Shariah in the first place.   10 August, 2014""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your revert 

Hello.

I would like to kindly request reconsideration of your revert (see link above). I had reinstated an edit removed based on a misunderstanding of a previous editor. The other IP user had replaced somebody else's comment with his own, and, when I attempted to take care of it, somebody had already reverted the edit, resulting in the old comment being restored and the new comment, which the IP editor posted (and removed the other comment in the process) being removed. Please browse the diffs starting from here. In my opinion, the edit was made in good faith. I restored the comment. The editor appeared to be legitimately inquiring about a deletion or revert. I reposted and signed it. I had noticed that you have reverted my edit. Please note that I have not at all made my edit in bad faith, and that I have never made bad faith edits to Wikipedia. I have been editing since 2008, had an account, but do not use it anymore since I am quite retired. I had a clean record and had never been blocked from editing. I do not know if it is possible to have those entries removed from the block log, since blocks count against an editor's reputation and I have not made any bad faith edits.

 Wrong Focus 

I'm new here, but it seems to me that this page, as it now reads, IS about IHD/CAD, to the exclusion of the remainder of cardiovascular disease.  While it may be true that the term """"is usually used to refer to those [diseases] related to atherosclerosis (arterial disease),"""" I would suggest that this is careless usage, to which this page need not subscribe. So how should the article be structured? I'd say look to the table of contents of a textbook of CV disease for a model, with the change that I would pull out all atherosclerotic vascular disease into its own section, with links in the relevant anatomic regions.  Other headings might include Congenital Heart Disease, Valvular Heart Disease, Cardiomyopathies, Dysrhythmias and Conduction Abnormalities, Diseases of the Coronary Arteries, Diseases of the Pericardium, Diseases of the Aorta and Great vessels, Brachiocephalic and Cerebrovascular Disease, Other Peripheral Vascular Disease, Arteritides, Systemic Hypertension, Thrombosis and Embolic Disease, Other Venous System Disease, Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature, and Heart Failure and Transplantation. Some discussion of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology,diagnosis, and therapy would also be germane. Although each of these would basically be a definition with a link to its own page, I think the result would be to give the reader a better picture of the vast scope of cardiovascular disease.

For willmcw

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia",0,0,0,0,0,0

Please read the relevant guideline, which is WP:EL.  Basically, there is no way to add that link.  We are not a linking site.  The only way that link could possibly appear would be if Dedalo were itself notable enough for an article.  This would only be if Dedalo had been discussed, several times, significantly, in reliable, independent sources.  So, if there are news articles or trade journals that discuss Dedalo (please note that press releases don't count), then we could consider making an article on Dedalo. If Dedalo does not rise to that level of importance, then it's somewhat possible that there could be a discussion of """"software used for ICH"""" in the ICH article.  You should discuss that with other editor's on that articles talk page.  You'll still need at least one reference in a reliable source to include the info, and you will not be able to add a direct link to the Dedalo website.

Hello, I was wondering if you would be willing to assist with the GA Sweeps process. We are currently looking over all of the GAs passed before August 2007 and determining if they still meet the criteria. After beginning with 2,808 articles we are now down to less than 900. Last month we had rapid progress, clearing over 300 articles. You've done a great job with the GA process, and with your contributions to so many GANs, I believe you would be a great reviewer for Sweeps. We are trying to complete the process in the next few months, and the best way to meet that goal is to have as many experienced reviewers as possible. I've given up reviewing GANs until this process is over, but you are under no obligation to do so. If you're interested in reviewing some articles, even if its only a few, it would be greatly appreciated. Instructions can be seen here. If you have any questions, let me know. Happy editing!

    To understand where Rich is right now is just half the equation, the other half lies in his history. Much of Rich's music tells the story of that history. Born in Riverside, California at just 15 years old his journey began. It was Rich's deep rooted love and passion for music evolving from a family of musicians, which really allowed him to turn his life around. This turnaround was despite all the trials and tribulations of his youth, while residing in Moreno Valley, California.
 
   Once in Seattle, Washington Rich embraced hip hop and rap music as well as the culture. Rich realized thru listening to the lyrics of others that he could really relate to what these rappers were saying. That is when Rich knew he too could share all that history he had bottled up inside thru his own lyrics. This is when hip hop really took over his life. Rich's level of musical development exploded, so he then channeled all his energy into writing and producing his own music. Rich is a producer and creator of addictive melodies, with beat wizardry that captures his audiences’ attention. They become mesmerized by his verbal versatility with stories, outlining and defining his truly most turbulent times.
 
   In 2003, Rich established a Washington, D.C. Metropolitan based Management, Production and Promotions Company called; HardHead Records. This brings us back to where Rich is today, HardHead Records has now commenced an exceptional business network with key associates in the music industry. Since its inception, Rich has gravitated towards some daunting, precarious projects highlighting the true and reliable nature of the company.
 
   In a time of everyone just being out there for themselves competition; HardHead Records remains committed to sponsoring and promoting local up in coming artists that are committed to something more than that. Artists of the DMV(Dc, Maryland & Virginia) that share a desire for unity amongst other artists. Rich has a vision of his trademark being something above and beyond the rest!
 
   Rich is currently working to create a movement in the DMV, a dynasty of sorts… evolving from the very best of the best. HardHead Records takes pride in preserving Rich's initial vision, which resonates his own virtues and beliefs. Rich strongly believes that in working together, in being unified and remaining true to himself and all those that choose to join the movement that unity will prevail. This prevalence of unity will in fact produce victory for all those that have wisely chosen to be involved.",0,0,0,0,0,0

How do you not understand that you're confirming that the Babylonian empire ended in 539 when its king was called to account?!!  
Strawman. Try again  talk 

Read Jeremiah 25:12. It gives an order of events. 1) 70 years ends. 2) Babylon's king is called to account. Babylon's king was called to account in 539. Ergo, 70 years ended in 539. Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609.  
As I keep telling you, your exegesis is fatuous for it obviates the context of 2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5 and Jeremiah 29:10, among others. Try again.  talk 

 Fringe Views? 

Please desist from changing articles to match the fringe views of Jehovah's Witnesses. You might like to start a section at articles' Talk pages, however it is unlikely that you will be able to indicate any widespread support for the alternative views taught by your religion. Thanks.  

How is it fringe when they're based on accurate and reliable sources? Wikipedia is a place for truth not your noetical bigotry.   
Reliable sources indicate the widely accepted chronology of the period. They do not support the JW chronology. And you didn't even provide any sources. You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views.  

Agreed. I've reverted you again.   
You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus’ first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or “the seventh month (Tishri)” as Ezra 3:1 says.

It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2)    

Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits.

Thank you for the reminder concerning the """"edit summaries"""" field.   

You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem.

I would like to strongly advise against deletion of this article on the argument that phylogenetics is not equal to, nor even synonymous to, cladistics. The difference between them is actually abyssal. Phylogenetics is a scientific discipline resting on the fundamental principle of objectivity, whereas cladistics instead is the opposite, resting on the principle of subjectivity. Phylogenetics partitions reality into categories (i.e. concepts) and discusses reality in terms of these categories, whereas cladistics instead assumes that categories (concepts) exist and confuses them. What phylogenetics discerns does cladistics confuse. In line with this approach, cladistics also strives hard to confuse itself (as a concept) with (the concept) phylogenetics and with (the concept) science. My empirical support for these allegations is that cladistics confuses time and space, thereby denying that time can be relative to space, which is contradicted by the fact that time is relative to space (see Envall, Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 94:217-220). Cladistics """"denies"""" the kind of thing it calls paraphyletic groups, which actually is a disguised denial of the fundament for science, that is, objectivity.

Deletion of this article would thus be devastating for phylogenetics, and in continuation, for encyclopedias (which tries to keep concepts apart) and maybe also for science itself. Instead, the article ought to be cleaned from cladistic influence. There is still a big part of phylogenetics that is (practically) free from cladistic influence, i.e., that which develops probability inferences of phylogeny, and still does the consistent conceptualization of phylogenies, that is, the Linnean system, occupy a central position in phylogenetics. 

A clensing of the article does, however, appear impossible in an open forum like this, since nothing can hinder cladists from incorporating their confusion in the article, whereas they can hinder a resolution of the confusion. The power over the content in articles is in practice related to number of proponents of certain comprehensions, rather than to knowledge about them or understanding of them. One can easily envision how Wikipedia would have appeared if it had been made of Germans during the 2:nd World War. Nazism would certainly not have been described in condescending terms. This is a fundamental problem for Wikipedia that needs to be addressed for Wikipedia to retain reliability. A basic requirement ought to be that its editors have at least some (scientific) education. There has to be some Captain(s) on the ship, and they have to have some (scientific) education. Otherwise, Wikipedia will gradually disintegrate into a mess.

If Wikipedia finds no other phylogeneticist that can (and wants to) clean up the article, I am prepared to do it. It does, however, require that I am given the power to include and exclude contributions to the best of my judgement and knowledge. My neutrality has been questioned in connection with my earlier contributions to Wikipedia, but as I have tried to explain, I consider a scientific approach (i.e., objectivity) to be neutral. The problem with cladistics is that it is subjective and """"denies"""" objectivity, since it leaves no neutral position between it and objectivity. There is no neutral position between a denial of a comprehension and that comprehension. I instead counter the """"denial"""" by falsifying it with empirical evidence. This does not """"counter-deny"""" cladistics, but only shows that cladistics does not agree with facts, whereas objectivity (i.e., science) does. I thus show that cladistics' """"denial"""" of science does not agree with facts. This conclusion is not neutral, but it is as neutral (or objective) as anything possibly can be. Questioning of this view on neutrality has to require an explanation of what else neutrality possibly can be. For me, neutrality is equal to objectivity. (Some claim that objectivity is impossible, but I claim that it is not. This is, however, another story).

I thus advise against a deletion of the article and announce myself as willing to clean the article from cladistic influence (on the condition that I'm given certain authorities). Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  )

Your reference to Canarias is understandable. However, Morocco cannot validly claim the canaries because there are 2 million canarians who are neither arabs nor muslims and who are spaniards wishing to remain part of the EU and of a democratic state. Morocco has no relation whatsoever with the canaries at any level neither culturally nor historically. If there was such a relation and morroco was a functioning democracy i would be the first to support a morrocan claim on the islands. I understand, for example and contrary to most spaniards, morocco's claim on western sahara. Firstly, the saharaouis are very few and their independence would clearly have been the result of european colonialism of the maghreb and algerian expansionism in the region. I understand how countries which have been subjected to the humiliation of colonialism feel, their borders being decided by foreign powers, and i believe that the polisario should take their people out of the horrendous conditions they live in in the camps of Tindouf and move back to their land. Dont forget the history of panama which was a farflung province of Colombia: The US paid the local Firebrigade to declare independence so that they could control such a strategic region...which they control to this day.

Starcheers doesn't say anything about banning stylization. He/she says that the inclusion of the """"#"""" isn't required. Allow me to explain why the inclusion of # is different to the inclusion of a letter. # stands for one of two things, its a symbolic representation of the word """"number"""" or it is a social media mechanism """"hash-tagging"""" most prominently used on twitter. If the name of the song was read and sung as """"hashtag that power"""" but was written as """"#thatPower"""" then including the """"#"""" is detrimental to the name. However, the name of the song as per what's song and said outloud is """"that power"""". Therefore the inclusion of the """"#"""" is for the social media mechanism rather than to represent the word """"number"""". As a result, the reason to include the """"#"""" is stylistic, i.e. its a stylistic choice for the copyright (the copyright being legally registering the song is a recorded work), but it is not pronounced in the work nor is it part of the title. the inclusion of """"i"""" in """"iphone"""" is not stylistic, it is part of the copyright and part of the name, thus including the i is detrimental to the work in question as a phone and an iphone are two different things whereas #thatpower and thatpower are one in the same, as in this context the """"#"""" has no meaning. —  [talk] 19:50, 21""",0,0,0,0,0,0

DOUBLE STANDARDS & NOT BEING NEUTRAL

Dear Wikinews, Wikipedia and """"WHOVILLE"""" since “conflict of interest” “neutral” is an important subject since “conflict of interest” is being herald by wikinews / wikipedia staff and volunteers, including being used by wikipedia/wikinews administrators and editors with which to have an article /story be deleted, and is grounds for action against a contributor, then please immediately provide documentation that editors, administrators and people providing articles and information to wikipedia and wikinews have no conflict of interest to the articles and stories they create, edit, supervise and/or contribute.  For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14"""", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..

I'm sure you can access the villages form Bulgarian wiki anyway. About dabbing links. Yes if one place in Bulgaria add ..., Bulgaria.

Big changes: There are NO links to other articles in this article. The interconnected nature of Wikipedia is its strength this needs to be changed! Your style of writing is too conversational for an informational article. Write as if you are the expert. 

Little changes: Using Wiki markup to force a table of contents at the beginning could add structure to this article. This might help you better relate a topic to the next topic you're going to discuss. I would also suggest moving the image up to the top of the article, so you can immediately communicate visually with the reader.

Style suggestions: It needs some spell check; read it out loud to catch them if your word processor didn't. It could also use some grammatical editing to avoid embarrassing apostrophes dropping in wherever they like. 

Visual suggestions: The figure is well-made (that is, it gets across the process of producing a river anticline) but it is not properly tagged according to wiki's copyright protocols and it could stand some labeling and uploading in a higher resolution.

Overall, you have a good start. Adding links to other articles and presenting the most professional article you can will help you get the rest of the way there. Cheers!",0,0,0,0,0,0

Some time back I removed this excerpt from the Drosopigi, Florina article.

Drosopigiotes (Greek: Δροσοπηγιώτες) represent a population of Greek immigrants who were past inhabitants of the village Drosopigi, Florina in Greece. At present, the city of Rochester has the largest concentration of immigrants and families that trace their roots to the historically significant village Drosopigi. This likely includes the following families: Dedes, Manou, Stathopoulos, Hantes, Marou, Harissis and Strembenis.  

With it, I created a new article named Drosopigiotes in Rochester, NY, and this was later inserted into the article Rochester, New York. A user questioned the validity of this claim, and it was thus removed.

On 28 December 2007,  asked if this claim could be verified in some documented form.  Since it wasn't my claim originally, I wasn't the correct person to defend the comment, so I left things as they stood.

All of those statements need to be referenced.  Leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information.  To point out one thing, I'll bring up Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012.

It's possible that some came from this as well, I can't tell.  I'll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic, so the article is riddled with grammatical errors, mostly incomplete sentences.

 Heather Mills talk page 

Hi, would you please take a look at the Heather Mills talk page, item: 04:45, 14 March 2012‎ Ralphfcolucci (talk | contribs)‎ . . (21,892 bytes) (+2,467)‎ . . (A Final Word). I saw that you quite rightly removed and blocked an annon user on the Heather Mills article page for personal abuse (01:37, 12 March 2012 Edgar181 (talk | contribs) blocked 24.90.128.161 (talk) (anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of 1 week (Violations of the Biographies of living persons policy) well I would suggest that this posting is roughly similar. It insinuates/states that Paul McCartney had to go to a VD doctor (no refs) and that he may have had to do the same (""""there is little doubt that he was aware of Ms. Mills’s special talents within 10 minutes of hopping into the sack with her"""" etc). It then goes on to a long, rambling diatribe about abuse and male prostitution! Apart from the unreferenced and malicious personal attacks about the subject, I contend that the posting has nothing to do with the subject of the article at all and at the very least should be removed.

Reply: I added another, different, quotation from the same article that helps firm up how Russell felt on the subject. I  believe this added material compliments rather than hinders the presentation; it makes it more conclusive. 

My statement that Russell never suggested organized prohibition on using blood represents the conclusion of a Modus Tollens argument. However, rather than speculating about what Russell did or did not suggest, my statement should have read that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. 

Modus Tollens would have us accept that had Russell, as president of the Watchtower organization, organized a prohibition on using blood among his followers then we would have seen organized prohibition on using blood among his followers. Since there is no record of such an organized prohibition among Russell’s fellow worshippers then the Modus Tollens argument form has us conclude that Russell never organized it. The underlying premises of this particular argument are 1) that Russell applied his presidency and that 2) his fellow worshippers acted on his presidential initiatives. There is ample evidence that Russell applied his presidency, and that his fellows acted on it. Hence, it is not my opinion that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. Rather, it is a logical end to a valid argument form based on evidenced premises. 

For the time being I have removed the statement about Russell and organized prohibition on blood under his presidency. If you dispute the validity of what I write above then please offer logical refutation, keeping in mind that logical constructions and conclusions are not at the mercy of preferential outcomes (i.e., private opinion). I make the latter comment only to demonstrate my commitment to logical conclusions is above my commitment to any personal opinions I may presently hold. If you fail to offer refutation within a reasonable time then I will return my comment to the history section, but in a more precise form.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Reason? 

Was there any reason that you removed several links to album reviews?

I thoroughly read your """"ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL"""" and what I don't get is why then have you not removed every link to every review on all of Wikipedia? They are all external links. They all """"tunnel people away from the wikipedia."""" So why then are you singling out a single website and removing all of the links to their reviews?  If you would have actually bothered to visit all the links (which I somehow doubt, as all your reverts were popups-assisted.. whatever that means) you would find actual album reviews that IMO are much better than some of the crap that Pitchfork spits out. 

I'd also like to add that it is people like you who make me not want to contribute to Wikipedia, and the reason I've never joined. Instead of editing pages for the sake of contributing, you've designated yourself as the be-all end-all """"link remover""""  where """"link remover"""" means """"person who removes others' valid contributions to bolster his own self-importance.""""

And if you even bother using """"promotion"""" as a reason that VacantLips' contributions to the reviews lists were """"spam,"""" then I'll have to ask you to remove all of the external links from the """"Reviews"""" sections on all album pages... Unless you have detailed accounts proving that the users who posted the external links weren't simply promoting their own websites. 

I'll expect that you revert your changes, once you realize you had no basis for removing the links in the first place.

Research on Italian Somalians

I appreciate your improvements,Middayexpress. I have done some research on books about the Italian Somalians and I hope you can find what you need. 

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:""""Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli"""" (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.

I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta. (my translation: the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50,000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties).

About Yaron Matras (Madaares)' edits

Yaron Matras, non-Romani Professor in Linguistics at the University of Manchester, with the username  keeps adding the mention that the Ḍom -> Rom theory is the mainstream, an obvious personal POV. Yes, it has anteriority as compared to Rajput -> Rom theory, but is certainly no mainstream. It was based simply on the assumption of a name similarity and a supposed similar low status. The fact is that these two assumptions were mostly based on the anti-Romani stereotypes and prejudices. There are plenty of possibilities of making connections between the word Rom and words from the Subcontinent  and also the peculiarities of the Romanipen do not suggest at all a low caste origin. Plus, the name Domba itself in the Subcontinent do not designate a specific ethnic group, it is just an exonyom given by the hight caste to some unrelated groups that have their own ethnic names. On these grounds this theory is dismissed as unscientific. And if it finds supporters mostly among non-Roma, as fitting their ideas about Roma, this does not mean it is mainstream. The other theory is obviously well represented worldwide.

I did not have previous encounters with Yaron Maras, but I see that this first one does not look at all as a positive one. I am not a member of any """"Romani Union of Romania"""" and I don't know of the existence of any such union. It is sad that he resorts to such cheap intimidations, probably fitting himself the image of those non-Romani researchers who """"seem to feel threatened by Romanies who are educated or who are branded as ‘activists,’ as though this were automatically a bad thing"""" as presented by Ian Hacock at Romani Origins and Romani Identity: A Reassessment of the Arguments. Is this a new proof that the Romani studies done by some non-Romanies are some of the last contemporary studies made in a colonialistic style?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

And, if you read the Mau abstract, there does seem to be evidence for the gene, they've narrowed down the probable location of the gene.  What is not known is if it has linkage to Sabino, and sabino may be caused by a number of different genes, of which only SB1 has been mapped:  """"So far, it is not known whether dominant white (W) and sabino spotting (S) share a common genetic background. In this study, a pedigree consisting of 87 horses segregating for dominant white (W) was used to genetically localize the horse (W)-locus. Microsatellite ASB23 was found linked to (W), which allowed us to map dominant white to a region on horse chromosome 3q22.""""

I have no problem with someone adding Pearl to the chart.  If there isn't a wikipedia article on it, maybe that needs to be done too.

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I didnt edit an existing page, I took the time to create my own page and it was taken down and the message, AS I STATED BEFORE, had YOUR NAME at the end of end it whether you deleted it or not, the message was from YOU so it was YOU that I replied to. I'm already over it, I dont care about complaining to an admin. because that will get me nowhere but I dont appreciate your condescending tone or the fact that you tried to call me out on the ownership thing.

I see that you have reverted some of your changes but it was interesting to question it. In any case, I think that it is redundant for aircraft articles to state a measure that is merely the ratio of two other measures already stated. Most readers don't care, and those that do care can calculate the ratio from the information provided. Wing loading and power to weight ratio are examples in that category.

Sorry, the """"three revert"""" thing was my mistake.

The """"indiscriminate collection of information"""" section of WP:NOT does not explicitly cover the issue, as Jeffrey O.

 Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more """"Critique of the Universe"""" 

This goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of the Lambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc """"add-ons"""" that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or """"unfalsifiable"""" hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), just like the existence of God hypothesis.

Heretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), """"the SM"""". Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist that SM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope can re-ascend to the Throne.

All of the indirect """"overwhelming evidence"""" for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to """"flatten"""" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or """"CMB"""" (ref). This proposed revision in the """"total mass"""" and the General Relativity (GR) concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will save not only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too! 

The """"inflaton particle"""" from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref). During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existence during this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption. 

This space-time bubble's surface traveled up the MOAB's hyperbolic field gradient at a velocity hundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's """"Inflation"""". Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature was several exponential decades of degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began to condense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref). The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent process ever since. It is this ongoing transition from a hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational field underlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).

This is not speculation. This is not my personal idea.

While that may be true, that Isshin and Shinji isn't as notable as I point out, the vizard page needs a whole new makeover if you were to merge Shinji's article because the format is just bleh.

 Current Speculation 

There has been discussion lately about the appropriateness of this section. I will be going out-of-town for the next 5 days, but in my absence I highly encourage the frequent editors of this section to realize the need (and act upon it) to permanently remove this section. Its existence violates:

  NPOV (nuetral point of view)

- No one can truly say how or even if the listed items will affect voters

Types of bias include:

Ethnic or racial bias, including racism, nationalism and regionalism. 
Corporate bias, including advertising, coverage of political campaigns in such a way as to favor corporate interests, and the reporting of issues to favor the interests of the owners of the news media. 
Class bias, including bias favoring one social class and bias ignoring social or class divisions. 
Political bias, including bias in favor of or against a particular political party or candidate. 
Religious bias, including bias in which one religious viewpoint is given preference over others. 
Sensationalism, which is bias in favor of the exceptional over the ordinary. This includes the practice whereby exceptional news may be overemphasized, distorted or fabricated to boost commercial ratings. 
Geographical bias which may for example describe a dispute as it is conducted in one country without knowing that the dispute is framed differently elsewhere. 

The presence of this section is biased on several of the basses listed above

Wikipedia articles are not:

Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article.

The ethnic Macedonians only have one autonym - Macedonian. They don't want to piss off the Greeks. The use of the term to refer to themselves and their language is not an attack on Greeks. If it were, they would use the autonym """"Greek"""" not """"Macedonian"""". And """"Aegean Macedonia"""" is not necessarily an irredentist term. It can be used as such, but it is also used just to refer to Macedonia, Greece. You use the term """"Greek Macedonia"""" which is considered offensive by ethnic Macedonians because it suggests that that area is Hellenic, as opposed to only being under the control/jurisdiction of the Greek government. And then comes the dispute about whether Macedonia, Greece is Hellenic or not.

To expand on one aspect of that: Wikipedia's three main content policies are:
WP:Neutral point of view, which Peridon mentioned,
WP:Verifiability: """"all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source... The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—whether readers can check that material in Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether editors think it is true.""""
WP:No original research: """"The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists.""""

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

 Carbon-Carbon 

Perhaps that could use a little more explanation, then. Carbon brakes  are carbon on carbon, in that the material is used as both brake pad and disc. However, the material used is a carbon-carbon composite: carbon fibres set in a carbon matrix (see Reinforced carbon-carbon for more technical stuff). It could actually be either reason I suppose, but they are normally referred to as 'carbon-carbon'. The topic is discussed in greater detail further down the article - I've put a '(see below)' at the first appearance of 'carbon-carbon' which links to the 'Technical innovation' section further down.

Thanks for all the further edits - I've only reverted one (sorry! -)). The direct quote from Michael Scarlett about the MRD/merde connection shouldn't be corrected (ellipsis is acceptable), even if wrong grammatically, since that's what he wrote. Unless I've misquoted of course, which I'll check when I can get my hands on the article.

One question - I don't understand why in """"He also became the first man to win a Formula One race in a car bearing his own name..."""" 'race' is now in italics. 'Race' as opposed to what?

Also - are you sure about removing non-breaking spaces for units? My recollection is that they are recommended.

Thanks again for spending so much time going through the article  - it really helps to have someone else go through. I'm rather to close to spot some of the errors, or to act as a reader fresh to the topic. Cheers.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 re: VfD bot assistant 
When you get to the actual closing process, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated.  So many of the decisions require multiple steps.  But I may not be the right person to ask.  I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions.  I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of """"simple"""" decisions.  I'll give it some thought, though.  

Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread?  If so, what parameters would have to be fed in?  How complex would it be to initiate the bot?  Would it be a different bot for """"keep"""" decisions vs """"delete"""" decisions?

The essential steps for a """"keep"""" decision are:
 Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}})
# Remove the VfD header from the page (which ''usually'' follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together
# Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion.  I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.

If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple """"keep"""" decision might be automatable with a single parameter.  """"Keep as merge"""", """"transwiki"""", etc. would still require extra steps.

The essential steps for a """"delete"""" decision are:
# Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order
# Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed)
# Sometimes, check """"what links here"""" and move or delete all those links
# Delete the page

I'm not sure I see how to automate that process.  There are too many variables.  I'll keep chewing on it, though.  Thanks again.  ~~~~""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't trust so much certain wikipedians and administrators but I have faith that in the end truth, justice and NPOV shall prevail. If not in the ANI, where admins seem to behave like a wolfpack, at least in first instance, in ArbCom. Policy is very clear and Shell Kinney simply broke all rules. 

In my appeal I also ask for Shell to be recused from further cases against me or related to the controversial article due to bias and misuse of admin privileges. 

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-existent races are not my primary interest.

Besides it may also raise awareness about misuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties.

As a fan of John Cena, I am against the hypocrisy of many of his critics for their 'Five Moves Of Doom' comments, especially since many of these people support Hogan, Boogeyman, and Batista, all of whom have not the same in-ring skill as Cena. However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

Bigfoot

Welcome back. Like the Devil and Daniel Webster. True, the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species, but is tentative, and unproven. But the search goes on for evidence. The extreme LENGTH of this search leads researchers, with or without PhDs, to speculate that there may be a""""Plan C"""" where the beings may be neither hoax, (too many sighitngs for that) nor zoological (no body) but instead may be a theoretical space-time creature. This has not yet been stated. It needs to be. Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct, there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti. But there is something else. This is being ignored and swept under the rug. Always remember that with no official funding, """"mainstream"""" science has no positive opinion on the topic, and the work goes on by unpaid PhDs and many amateurs, and one paid non-academic.

Now, we, the Six, on the BF Edit Committee in Berkeley, will edit and re edit, and revert 
until the end of time to get the true and correct word out to readers. We will NOT
go away. Editors would be well-advised to work with our suggestions, since we know the literature and most editors never cracked a book. They, except one or two, do not kow squat on the topic, and most are lost in the theoretical quagmire. Most, it seems, 
are also uneducated. Daniel, welcome back.

Have you heard of Ševčenko's law? One hundred and fifty years, or more, of """"serious"""" history and good old Dan's dog is the first to pick this tree. 
From what I understood of it, and it's rather over my head, Mc Carthy has a point. However, it would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater to adopt his dates before anyone else does. It means that every date in a book needs to be Mc Carthy-ised. 
And even then I have very serious doubts about the accuracy of the results. Mc Carthy's method may give accurate AD dates, but I suspect there are problems. Take 763. He's content to put Domnall Midi's death in that year, just as the historians are, but why does AD 763 start with an event dated to 20 November? Fair enough, that could just be a glitch from the compilation, but it could also be that whatever the source was, its years did not start on 1 January or March 25 but instead on 1 September. Adding that to an article would be WP:OR, so we won't do that - we do when it's Bede's years because people have discussed it in print, but this they haven't - but we can take it into consideration here when deciding what to do. 
The Chronicle of Ireland was compiled from lots of sources and it would be a reasonable bet that even if most or nearly all of them started the year on 1 January, some would have done so on 25 December, some on 1 September, and some on 25 March. Even if Mc Carthy's system is perfect, you can only be entirely confident about the year if the event falls between 25 March and 31 August.
If we can date events to within a year either way, that's good, if we can date events in the 7th century to within 2 or 3 years, that's marvellous. If it were me, I'd go with """"historian"""" dates, i.e. what Byrne, Charles-Edwards and the rest say, and add Mc Carthy's corrections in a footnote, which is what is done with Penda of Mercia and other C7th Anglo-Saxons where there is a similar, but smaller, problem.

In fact, a book of Lawrence Stone's (as I recall) demonstrates that Lord Burghley put the Earl of Rutland, a royal ward, on his feet again financially through his management of Rutland's affairs during Rutland's wardship (Lord Burghley was a good friend of Rutland's stepmother).  The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.

Just logged into find loads of stuff about you.  It looks like it's getting harder for you having to do lots of edits, before your main edits.  Is it worth the effort x

Hello there, me old fruit!

It is true that it's getting harder for me with having to put in ten edits before I can use my accounts. They sometimes get spotted and blocked whilst I'm making the ten edits, especially if I've just used an account and especially if User:Hut 8.5's online. I have generally targeted a dormant user talk page or tagged my own sockpuppets to achieve the ten edits.

It is not too difficult yet. User:Raul654 has put in loads of IP rangeblocks which do restrict me. I can generally get on using BT.

There seems to be a concerted effort now by many different users to revert my edits quickly. I suppose a good measure of my effectiveness is the percentage of the time that my edits are visible, or whether the page is fully protected. That percentage is very low at the moment. VICS is fully protected, but Northwich Victoria F.C. and Witton Albion F.C. are not.

It is worth the effort; I still hate the whole Wikipedia concept of truth by consensus. I can cope with being reverted within minutes by many different editors, being checkusered regularly and blocked on sight. User:Raul654's checkuser investigations are only about 95 - 98% accurate in terms of percentage of accounts that he labels actually being me.

 Addressing your concerns 

888fortune, I found your comments at Duke53's talk page that flesh out some of your concerns.  I'm glad to see them, and I'm sorry I didn't spot them before I left my earlier message.  I'd like to try to address some of those concerns.

If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), this seems to be your core concern: """"I believe it is confusing to a person searching for that name to find another name.""""  You might be unaware of this, but Wikipedia has a """"redirect"""" feature that can take a commonly used search term and re-point it to the article it refers to, if that article exists under a different name.  You can try this: type """"The Wild Center"""" into Wikipedia's search box; it should take you to the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article.

From a reader's perspective, the redirect does have the potential to be confusing: """"I typed in one thing, and the big headline at the article says something completely different!""""  Naturally we don't want such confusion.  There are two things that can help.  One is that Wikipedia will show a little message saying """"(Redirected from The Wild Center)"""" so the user at least knows they didn't somehow hit the """"Random article"""" link or something like that.  Another one that the editors of the target article can do is to make sure the common search terms are mentioned.  In this case, the article's lead sentence highlights this by introducing """"The Wild Center"""" as an alternative name, and it's in boldface so it's harder to miss.  A person searching on """"The Wild Center"""" and arriving at the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article will probably not be very confused, since they'll see """"The Wild Center"""" prominently displayed on the page, and since they'll more than likely already know that The Wild Center is a museum of natural history located in the Adirondacks, so the full official name is unlikely to surprise them.

You also say """"I think that the Museum has the right to choose its own name.""""  I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but it's reasonable to think that the nickname """"The Wild Center"""" could be in vogue for a few years and then replaced by another nickname. (""""The Otter Stop"""", perhaps? )  If there's a stable, official name that will stick with it for as long as it's a museum, it makes some sense to use that name for the article title and to set up redirects for all of the popular nicknames.  The purpose of Wikipedia is not to aid the museum in marketing itself, but it's definitely reasonable to adopt some of the marketing phrases if that's how a significant number of people might identify the place.

Does this satisfy any of your concerns?  I'm interested in your response.  /talk/ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Response to help desk

Hi Rockingchick. Sorry your article was deleted, but it sounds like you were writing a biography of a non-notable person. We can't generally let people write articles about people they know or knew personally because it violates our policies of having everything verified by reliable sources (if you write about someone the wider world hasn't heard of we have no way of making sure what you wrote is true) and writing from a neutral point of view (you can't be neutral about someone you know personally). There are more specific guidelines as to who's considered notable at WP:BIO.

If you'd like some ideas for a good first article, you can try the Your first article (which is more a list of """"don't""""s) and the Requested articles pages. The community portal also has lots of other ways in which people can contribute to Wikipedia apart from writing new articles.

Hope this won't put you off editing Wikipedia, it can be quite hard to get stuck in at first, but don't worry - although sometimes it seems otherwise, people are always happy to put your mistakes right as long as you don't make a habit of repeating them.  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Questionable """"Unresolved Disruptive Technologies"""" 

Some of the examples of """"unresolved"""" technologies promoted as disruptive cannot honestly be considered """"unresolved"""".  The most glaring of these is """"e-commerce vs. physical shops"""".  It is absolutely clear that both e-commerce and physical shops are completely entrenched in their own respective niches, and while there is a lot of competition between them in some areas, the idea that either one could entirely supplant and eliminate the other in the forseeable future* is lunacy.  Similar arguments apply to """"free / open-source vs. proprietary software"""" and """"Internet Video on Demand and IPTV vs. Advertising supported broadcast and cable television"""".

The examples of """"Music downloads and File sharing vs. compact discs"""", """"ebooks vs. paper books"""", and """"VoIP (and VoIP over 802.11) vs. traditional telephone and mobile phone service"""" are much better examples of """"unresolved"""" potentially disruptive technologies.

""""forseeable future"""" in this case refers to the current world we live in, free from instantaneous teleportation, William Gibson-style """"simstim"""", and other similarly sci-fi developements.

0f63f20906eef7c0,"""For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.

The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems:
""""In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. 

The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, """"The Living Legend,"""" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.

Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.

Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""""

IIRC, Cylon.org had a page on this at one time, but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared.

Happy to add some references and beef up the text when I get chance. But here's one quote from Ratzinger which comes directly before the quotre about it being a"""" fundamental threat to the church.""""

1. Liberation theology is a phenomenon with an extraordinary number of layers. There is a whole spectrum from radically marxist positions, on the one hand, to the efforts which are being made within the framework of a correct and ecclesial theology, on the other hand, a theology which stresses the responsibility which Christians necessarily hear for the poor and oppressed, such as we see in the documents of the Latin American Bishops' Conference (CELAM) from Medellin to Puebla. In what follows, the concept of liberation theology will be understood in a narrower sense: it will refer only to those theologies which, in one way or another, have embraced the marxist fundamental option. Here too there are many individual differences, which cannot be dealt with in a general discussion of this kind. All I can do is attempt to illuminate certain trends which, notwithstanding the different nuances they exhibit, are widespread and exert a certain influence even where liberation theology in this more restricted sense does not exist.

As can be seen he is being quite clear in that only one strand of liberation theology is being condemned.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

As you may recall, I gave one of these at Southampton last month on a topic of mutual interest.

Asking for the citation seemed that natural and polite thing to do. It turns out, Vordox meant """"Masem’s talk page""""; I've seldom seen that usage in Wikipedia or elsewhere.

 You know, I'd be in favour of a reduced Studio Alliances section (""""Studio Support""""), given this isn't a comparison article and as written the whole thing is utterly unreadable. Something along the lines of a bulleted list of studios supporting HD DVD (with an appropriate asterisk and comment next to WB), and a short paragraph reporting that many studios have decided to actively not support HD DVD, preferring Blu-ray, and reporting the major ones. The way I see it, it would work something along the lines of:

Studio Support

To date, approximately 30% of recently released movies are available in HD DVD format. The following studios and publishers offer HD DVD content:

Universal Studios (including subsidiaries Focus Features and Rogue Pictures)
Paramount Pictures
Nickelodeon Movies
MTV Films
DreamWorks Pictures and DreamWorks Animation
The Weinstein Company (including Dimension Films).
The BBC
First Look Studios
Image Entertainment (including the Discovery Channel)
Magnolia Pictures
Brentwood Home Video
Ryko
Koch/Goldhil Entertainment
Medusa Home Entertainment
Studio Canal
Universum Films
Kinowelt Home Entertainment
DVD International
Opus Arte
MK2
Momentum Pictures
Twister Home Video

Additionally Warner Brothers currently releases its content on HD DVD, though has announced it will cease supporting HD DVD in June 2008.

Many major studios have chosen not to support HD DVD, having decided to exclusively back the rival Blu-ray format. These studios include Fox, Disney, and many others.
This is a much simpler and easier to read than the current """"ACME studios announced it plans to support HD DVD for three weeks in March, but pr0n Studios Inc has released 72% of its content in the Chinese EVD format but plans to switch to HD DVD in 2009"""" format that the section is in currently. And it does do away with the need to have a graph in that section as it's no longer a richard-waving area.

From the 1911 Britanica Encyclopedia:

Greek Speculations
Ancient Greece supolies us with 
the first important contributions to aesthetic theory, 
though these are scarcely, in quality or in quantity, what 
one might nave expected from a people which had so high an 
appreciation of beauty and so strong a bent for philosophic 
speculation.  The first Greek thinker of whose views on the 
subject we really know something is Socrates.  We learn from 
Xenophon's account of him that he regarded the beautiful as 
coincident with the good, and both of them are resolvable 
into the useful.  Every beautiful object is so called because 
it serves came rational end, whether the security or the 
gratification of man.  Socrates appears to have attached 
little importance to the immediate gratification which a 
beauriful object affords to perception and contemplation, 
but to have emphasized rather its power of furthering the 
more necessary ends of life.  The really valuable point in 
his doctrine is the relativity of beauty.  Unlike Plato, 
he recognized no self-beauty (auto to kalon) existing 
absolutely and out of all relation to a percipient mind. 

Plato

Of the views of Plato on the subject, it is hardly less difficult 
to gain a clear conception from the Dialogues, than it is in 
the case of ethical good.  In some of these, various definitions 
of the beautiful are rejected as inadequate by the Platonic 
Socrates.  At the same time we may conclude that Plato's mind 
leaned decidedly to the conception of an absolute beauty, 
which took its place in his scheme of ideas or self-exisiing 
forms.  This true beauty is nothing discoverable as an 
attribute in another thing, for these nre only beautiful things, 
not the beautiful itself.  Love (Eros) produces aspiration 
towards this pure idea.  Elsewhere the soul's intuition of the 
self-beautiful is said to be a reminiscence of its prenatal 
existence.  As to the precise forms in which the idea of beauty 
reveals itself, Plato is not very decided.  His theory of an 
absolute beauty does not easily adjust itself to the notion 
of its contributing merely a variety of sensuous pleasure, 
to which he appears to lean in some dialogues.  He tends 
to identify the self-beautiful with the conceptions of the 
true and the good, and thus there arose the Platonic formula 
kalokagathia. So far as his writings embody the notion of 
any common element in beautiful objects, it is proportion, 
harmony or unity among their parts.  He emphasizes unity in 
its simplest aspect as seen in evenness of line and purity of 
colour.  He recognizes in places the beauty of the mind, and 
seems to think that the highest beauty of proportion is to 
be found in the union of a beautiful mind with a beautiful 
body.  He had but a poor opinion of art, regarding it as a 
trick of imitation (mimesis) which takes us another step 
farther from the luminous sphere of rational intuition into 
the shadowy region of the semblances of sense.  Accordingly, 
in his scheme for an ideal republic, he provided for the most 
inexorable censorship of poets, &c.;, so as to make art as far 
as possible an instrument of moral and political training. 

Aristotle

Aristotle proceeded to a more serious investigation of the 
aesthetic phenomena so as to develop by scientific analysis 
certain principles of beauty and art.  In his treatises on 
poetry and rhetoric he gives us, along with a theory of these 
arts, certain general principles of beauty; and scattered among 
his other writings we find many valuable suggestions on the same 
subject.  He seeks (in the Metaphysics) to distinguish the 
good and the beautiful by saying that the former is always in 
action (`en praxei) whereas the latter may exist in motionless 
things as well (`en akinetois.) At the same time he had 
as a Greek to allow that though essentially different things 
the good might under certain conditions be called beautiful.  
He further distinguished the beautiful from the fit, and in 
a passage of the Politics set beauty above the useful and 
necessary.  He helped to determine another characteristic 
of the beautiful, the absence of all lust or desire in the 
pleasure it bestows.  The universal elements of beauty, 
again, Aristotle finds (in the Metaphysics) to be order 
(taxis), symmetry and definiteness or determinateness (to 
orismenon).  In the Poetics he adds another essential, 
namely, a certain magnitude; it being desir",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Yet my last sentence in my foregoing post is perfectly veridical. Even now Jeffro77 (and you) are unaware of the illiterate nature of his edit even though I reproduced it for him (from the """"Existence of God"""" Talk page): """"The Deutsch citation is entirely correct, and the quoted text is available at the linked article in the citation. Failing to use the exact citation supplied by you is immaterial."""" But as anyone who is literate can see, his citation is incorrect: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""".

 """"Chapter 14"""" of what book? By whom?

 Nor did I ever call anyone at Wikipedia a bully. That's a false claim by you. You therein protest too much (cf. Hamlet, Act III, Scene II, line 240).

 As well, I don't merely make charges, I prove what I state. Jeffro77 and Ilkali both repeatedly made false claims regarding the subject for which there is no excuse due to the information being readily at hand within either the subsection under question itself or in the hyperlinked Wikipedia articles. Neither of them knew the slightest thing about the Omega Point Theory other than that they knew that its author maintains that it physically proves God's existence, which was all it took to rile them up. While lacking knowledge about a subject is not itself an error, what is completely uncalled for is to have vociferous opinions on an issue while remaining in that state of ignorance.

 That's the current state of this matter. Those who have repeatedly shown a willingness to make factually false statements on the matter, and whose ignorance regarding the subject is nearly complete, now have their illiterate and clownishly censorial, and indeed illogical, edit showing.

 Regarding the illogic of the edit, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he deleted mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

 So by Jeffro77's own words, he must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted mention of this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

 Jeffro77's edit is so ridiculously biased and illogical that it's a sick joke.74.4.222.208  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You referred edit readers to """"Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria items #3(a) and #8).""""  Thank you for the reference.

Regarding #3(a):  I agree that I went way beyond minimal use, although I will say that this was without knowing of the 10 non-free content rules.  My question is, does this mean that you needed to remove all album cover images and music samples?  When I added the images, I was using """"The Beatles"""" article as a reference.  Looking at it now, I see that """"The Beatles Discography"""" is without images, although the main article still contains music samples.  Does minimal use mean """"No use""""? (referring to there being no images at all on the Harvest page).  Why is showing album cover art excessive?  I have a feeling I'm asking a common question.

Regarding #8 (significance):  Is the discography considered a list?  I would assume so.  I guess this would be why no image- photo or song sample is allowed within it.  I would think this rule alone would suffice for removing all of the images I had put in the article, since they were all within the Discography section.  Would it be acceptable to create a separate section for music samples, as in the Beatles article?  If so, how many music samples would be allowed?  25?, as in that article?

I would really appreciate you responding to this post.  I would like to know what you think.  And I would also like to find out if any of the images/samples I uploaded are salvageable.  This would save me time in re-uploading if they are.

Thanks for your time and efforts in editing,

Hello Attilios! First, thanks for your appreciative comments! I certainly plan to complete and bring the rest of the Isaurian period article to the same level, and then probably do the Amorian period too, for they are perhaps the most under-appreciated periods in the Empire's history. The other periods also need lots of work of course, but it will be some time before I will be able to do anything about that. I've got a couple of dozen ongoing projects or other articles I want to do, so time is short. Any help you can offer will, of course, be appreciated, be it pointing out an unclear sentence or a mistake, or adding some important point you feel I overlooked. Just be bold and edit. Since Byzantium is an area where only a handful of editors are active, IMO, if you can go ahead and write up even a sketchy, rudimentary outline on some of these topics (e.g. the horribly short Byzantium under the Justinian dynasty), you'd be helping a great deal. And if you can bring some respectable Italian sources in, that'd be a further bonus.

For the map, it has some problems, and I have been revising it for some time now, although the present status is still nowhere near good enough for it to be uploaded. For Naples and Gaeta, both cities are usually listed as acknowledging at least nominal Byzantine suzerainty at the time, their rulers accepting Byzantine titles etc. Now I admit that Byzantine Italy is not my field of expertise, so if you have some good sources to show otherwise, I'll change that too.

 For Richard 20Feb07
Unfortunately Haar 2005 – reviewed the book this is not about explsion 1944-1948(1950) it is about ethnic cleanings before 1945 done by Germans and scientists who supported this ideas.
Overmans book 2000, “Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg.” Is strictly about German military losses nothing more – nothing there about expulsion?

I confess that I don't know what Nitschke has to say on this subject.

She says: “Of around 12.4 million Germans within the lands of post-war Poland in 1944, six million fled or were evacuated, 3.6 million were expelled, one million were verified as Poles, 300,000 remained in Poland as a German minority, and up to 1.1 million died (p. 280).”
Thus that means TOTAL: 1.1 millions deaths.

She also says: “Though estimates of the dead range widely, as many as ‘’’a million Germans’’’ perished during flight and expulsion from Poland in 1944-45.”

It means in years 1946 - 1950? 100.000. Take for consideration that so call wild expulsion started on May 1945 and the 1944 and first part of 1945 was actually the flight.

Next she says: “In the long fourth chapter, Nitschke turns to the expulsions, which came in three waves. During a period of """"wild expulsions"""" from May to July 1945, the Polish military drove up to 400,000 Germans across Poland's new western border.”

“The second wave of expulsions came after the Potsdam conference, but before the """"organized transfer"""" of remaining Germans began in early 1946. From August to December, 1945, Poles expelled close to 600,000 more Germans in poorly organized transports.”

“The final phase involved the transfer of 2.25 million Germans in a process coordinated with British and Soviet authorities in occupied Germany in 1946 and 1947.” """,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are two FeloniousMonk's!

One must be a sockpuppet. I edited the intro to say:

The canonical definition of the Discovery Institute's Intelligent Design is that Intelligent Design (sometimes abbreviated ID) is the controversial assertion that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection. Intelligent Design is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, a conservative Christian think tank. The idea has been around since 1990.

Just like FeloniousMonk said above:

The canonical definition of intelligent design, which is the one offered by the Discovery Institute (""""that certain features of the universe and of living things exhibit the characteristics of a product resulting from an intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such as natural selection"""") Since ID is wholly a product of the Discovery Institute, with every leading ID proponent is one of its Fellows and every campaign and strategy arising from its offices, defining ID as they do is necessary in the intro for any of the claims made in the article by Dembski, Behe or Johnson to make any sense. Any intro that ignores the canonical definition is deficient.

At this point, I think maybe the best way to go would be to request the page be moved to something like List of cults, sects, and new religious movements, like I proposed on the article talk page. The early years of the study of NRMs did include a lot of discussion of what might today be called """"non-religious"""" cults, like therapy cults, which might not be specifically religious, but do perhaps have most if not all of the characteristics of cults. The RfC was closed based on the question of criteria for inclusion, and taking that into account, changing the title or otherwise changing the criteria for inclusion would be the next apparent reasonable step.

I agree with George Profulis, a respected local meterologist. New Jersey is hit by a Category 1 or 2 storm directly (landfall) about once every 100 years (last in 1903, putting us 6 years overdue), and by a Category 3 or 4 landfalling storm every 200 years (last 1821, 188 years ago, coming due soon). Major storms passing within 50 miles off our coast ('38, '44, Donna, Belle, Gloria) causing a """"direct hit"""" are far more common, and can be just as damaging and deadly. I would say that a repeat of '44 today, would cause Katrina-like damage in the Northeast. New Jersey might be small, but it is also the most densely populated state in the nation. Many of the homes, especially those along the shore, are only a few feet apart.  A good storm surge like seen in '44 would devastate 100 miles of prime real estate that is far more valuable per square mile then that along the Gulf Coast. Also, strong storms passing to our west (Gale of 1878, Tropical Storm David in 1979) can put N.J. in a storm's right front quadrant, the most vicious part of the cyclone""",0,0,0,0,0,0

In no way am I asserting that you are related to Pol64, although from the backlog of checkuser requests it is as clear to me as it is to anyone else that a lot of suspicions have been raised, based on may I say particularly intriguing patterns. For example, your last session stopped and began directly before and after Pol64's, repeating a pattern that was identified in one of those earlier checkuser requests.

af2bb3bd2d5d0adb,"Mako, I have continued to collect all of the material and will continue to do so following your excellent guidance and will contact you shortly. In the meantime and as you can see, SkaraB/Mediahound is celebrating its “VICTORY” to harm the ICD and continuing with the campaign to harm the ICD in every possible way. Now “they” are going through the ICD Advisory Board members list and deleting references to the ICD. For example, Erna Hennicot-Schoepges, the Vice President of the ICD got “a visit” from them and they deleted any reference to the ICD, ignoring the fact that in her own website the Vice President mentions her role on the icd and of course it is also mentioned in the ICD website:

See here (scroll down to the very bottom): http://ehennicotschoepges.lu/cv/ 

The anonymous editor is continuing like that with all of the pages of ICD members and will probably continue on the hunt against the ICD any way possible. This is of course not good for the Wikipedia and administrators and high level management of Wikipedia must be involved in this as this can have consequences for Wikipedia. I will now continue to observe and watch the activity of SkaraB and Media Hound and document all of their activities. At the same time, I will deliver the findings to Wikipedia authorities in order to stop this activity, as it has been going on for years already. I just wanted to let you know, however I am sure from the encouragements that I see in your talk page that Skara B and Media Hound have already contacted you and this game of theirs is already well known by you.

I will appreciate your advice here. Greetings.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Shuki, you'll be pleased to know that I've created a new, objective category - Sephardic Orthodox rabbis. Unlike many other recently created categories that have been bitterly disputed, this category doesn't rank Rabbonim by how Frum they are or their political beliefs. In short, it's absolutely impossible to argue why any of the Rabbis have been placed in it - because of course they're all Sephardi. I hope you like it and that this simplifies matters.

For the benefit of those who may be following this discussion, I'll post my clarification from your talk page:

""""Looking at the games in order of best sales, they'd be VII, X, VIII, IX, X-2, VI, etc. Obviously Sephiroth merits his own article, and Seymour probably makes sense as well, but out of the next titles, Kuja's got one while Ultimecia, Kefka and Shuyin don't. Given this and Kuja's already substantial section on the list of FFIX's characters, as well as the fact that describing IX's story comprehensively will require a pretty thorough explanation of him anyway (sales figures aside, he is the central conflict of the game, really; the same can't really be said of Seifer with VIII or Seymour in X; in order for them to get proper coverage, they'd have to get their own articles), it seems to me like him having his own article's kind of unnecessary. Any discussion of him is really a discussion of the game's story, and any discussion of the game's story is going to largely be a discussion of him, so I just think it will probably make for some somewhat unnecessary reiteration across the three articles (Final Fantasy IX, List of Final Fantasy IX characters and Kuja).

He's certainly a notable villain, though. I'm just saying that in light of the treatment of most of the other notable villains and given the already thorough treatment of Kuja's role, it seems somewhat unnecessary for him to have his own article.""""

By the way, I would say we're always POV in how we decide such matters. Deciding matters of inclusion is inherently going to be based on POV. However, that isn't a problem, as policy for neutral point of view only applies to how information's presented, not how it's selected. By necessity, selecting information for inclusion is a half-POV/half-NPOV matter, based on notability (POV) and verifiability (NPOV).  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

whatever....I did NOT say I would edit war, in fact I said I would be careful NOT actually edit war, but to simply place a word that belongs in the article, that Nova keeps having issues with.   Are you saying that I don't have the right in the """"future"""" to ever put in anything simply cuz Nova would object?     My hands would have to be tied, you're saying??

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it """"personal"""" long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway. (I have other accounts and even other IPs anyway.....but I probably won't even use them, as I don't really care to be wasting time on this stuff, anymore.)  Nova has no business on Wikipedia. He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...

Hi. About Cybercopyedit's changes to Optics: This isn't sockpuppetry. I complained that his previous username did not comply with policy and he handled it by creating a new one, which is one of the recommended ways to deal with that problem. 

I think he may have a valid point about Alhazen's book. The article's previous statement that the book merely """"documented the then-current understanding of vision"""" does not appear to be supported by the reference that was already cited in the article. I took a quick skim through the parts of it that are freely accessible earlier today, and it appeared to show that Alhazen's work significantly expanded on the previous understanding of the subject. Based on that one reference (not contributed by Cybercopyedit as far as I know), it appears that a stronger statement of Alhazen's contribution is warranted.

I ask you that you re-consider the closure as no-consensus. !vote-wise delete is ahead, but reading the !votes and looking at the sources it is clear that the argument for deletion as per WP:NF was stronger. There was exactly one good argument to keep, and it was User:Schmidt's argument. But even he recognized it as """"weak"""", and really the sources he provided wer enot osurces of notability, not existence. It should have been closed as delete, as it really doesn't meet the criteria for notability that apply.

I noticed that you and I seem to post in one or two articles dealing with progressive issues in political science/sociology.
There's currently a debate beginning in Boston Tea Party as to whether the article should include the category . It meets definitions set in the articles Terrorism and Definition of terrorism, however, there are several self-proclaimed patriots who watch BTP who refuse to recognise the fact.
The simple criteria for terrorism generally seem to be intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared. Some users would rather use recent acts of terrorism as a yardstick, rather than using a firm definition, and hence lose their ability to discuss matters calmly.

  It was in that year that Albino Mhelembe, a Mozambican working in the mines of Johannesburg, South Africa, heard the good news of God’s Kingdom. The seeds of Kingdom truth took root in his heart, and soon he got baptized. Returning home, he began to preach to the members of his former church, the Swiss Mission, in Vila Luísa (presently Marracuene), in the southernmost province of Mozambique. The newly interested Africans were very zealous and often traveled 20 miles [30 km] to get to meetings. New groups were started, including one in Lourenço Marques, now Maputo.

 POV/inaccurate paragraph 

The Vlachs did not pass the same process of forcible Romanization of alphabet or vocabulary as the Romanians in Romania

Forcible? Nobody forced anyone to change the words one uses. There were French borrowings, but this was done also by Bulgarians and Russians, for example. There was an idea in 19th century to eliminate Slavic words from Romanian and it was labeled as absurd.

and they usually say that they are descendants of Romanized Moesians, compared to the Romanized Gheto-Dacians in Romania. The fact is that both Moesians and Gheto-Dacians were the Thracian tribes, so the substrate was not so different. 

Yes, most linguists think that Moesians and Geto-Dacians spoke the same language, labeled by some """"Daco-Moesian"""", but that's off-topic here. Linking modern people to ancient peoples is nonsense. It's absurd to say that some are descendants from """"Geto-Dacians"""" and others from the """"Moesians"""".

Anyway, the Romanians of Wallachia and Vlachs of Serbia speak the same language! I mean even the same dialect! The southern """"Wallachian"""" dialect is what became standard Romanian language. 

Some Vlachs usually emphasize that the difference between them and Romanians """"are the same as the difference between the Serbs and Bulgarians"""".

So, Serbian language is identical to Bulgarian ? I learnt something new today, then. -)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Most fundamentally, you all still need to establish your great mighty virtue in the process of shattering the old forces’ persecution, and return to your highest positions. So this isn’t a matter of reaching Consummation in ordinary realms, nor is it achievable in ordinary Consummation. It might seem that you have done what you should do for Dafa, when actually, you are doing it for your comprehensive Consummation and return. If during this period you cannot do well with what you should do, this Consummation stage can only be a cultivation process, and it cannot fundamentally be a Fa-rectification disciple’s true and final Consummation. If during the evil’s persecution a Dafa disciple doesn’t do well or slacks off, it’s very possible all his previous efforts will have been for nothing.

In other words, if you can't live up to the challenge of """"shattering the old forces's persecution"""" you can't consider yourself a Fa-rectiication disciple.  And what distinguishes a """"Fa-rectificatrion disiciple""""  from an common ordinary disciple?  Well, it's what you do to protect the Master's Fa against the evil forces, isn't it?   Elsewhere the Master actually says this is you duty as a practitioner.

 To all of you who think this can not be true 

I live in Sweden. My sister was locked up against her will in a similar institution here in Sweden (but run by the municipality) when she got her first child without being married. And the bureaucrats tried to take her child. In that institution there were a number of women locked up that just had given birth. Their only """"crime"""" being that they got a child without being married, the father of the child """"being absent"""" and not protecting the woman and the woman not having a family that could protect her. 

When my family finally found out where my sister was we managed to liberate her. (The bureaucrats clearly had not realised that my sister had a big family that could protect her.) After that the bureaucrats attacked us by all legal (and illegal) means at their disposal. We had to keep my sister hidden from the authorities for several months while we informed the politicians and gathered evidence to defend ourselves against the bureaucrats. Finally with the help of some politicians the bureaucrats were made to stop their efforts to take my sisters child and locking her up again. Afterwards our lawyer said that as far as she knew we were the first family ever in Sweden to manage to keep a child in spite the bureaucrats being on full attack. And this happened as recently as 1999-2000.

Why the bureaucrats do these things I don't know. Perhaps there is black money to get in the adoption business or they simply do it so they """"have something to do"""" so their department won't get downsized. The scary thing is that this is an ongoing thing, defenceless women (but good mothers) are still being locked up and get their babies taken like that in Sweden.

2.) These loans are extemely expensive for seniors and until regulated or limited more heavily I think they should be avoided i.e. upfront costs are absolutely too high!

3.) You may get 60% to 70% of your equity in monthly installments / payments but, you are also loosing equity in that the interest (you are not paying) is compounded on the back of the loan.  Interested is paid on the principal balance (growing each month) but also compounded on top of interest on top of interest.  So, when you get to the end of the loan you may have given up 30% to 40% of your homes equity to obtain a fraction in a monthly payout / installment.  It would be wise for seniors to sell instead of taking on this risky loan program.

Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position?

Most of your edits are fine. Thank you for restoring previous edits in a non-POV way which I think is acceptable. Most of the article is fine. I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher's own (and perhaps biased) opinion?

Second, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel's thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore's success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, """"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi and welcome to Wikipedia.  I thought I would let you know of a few guidelines we follow when we edit articles:
 Please use an edit summary when making edits.  This is useful for other editors to see at a glance what were the changes you made.
 Please use the Preview button (right beside the Save Page button) when making changes, so that you don't have to make numerous minor edits one right after another.  This keeps the history smaller and allows other editors to see more easily what changes you made.
 If you make minor edits, please check the """"Minor Edit"""" checkbox right above the Save Page button.

Disputes of content review
 Does M. Vickers use one sided only information, as it was reported by Alexikoua?
 Was there any usage of the """"Cham"""" term, before the 20th or 19th Century?
 Was the cham eviction specifically ordered by British liaison to EDES, Col. Chris Woodhouse?
 Where is the citation of  Τρίτου, Μιχαήλ. Τσάμηδες: Επίμαχο Πρόβλημα Ελλάδος και Ορθόδοξου Εκκλησίας Αλβανίας. Εκδοτικός Οίκος Κυρομάνος: Θεσσαλονίκη, 2003. In which he reports that the Muslim Chams of Thesprotia come from native Christian Greeks of which for different reasons and at different times converted to Islam.
 Why is Kollias an unreliable source whereas Vickers is one?
 Are the refs used to create the Map of Chameria WP:RS? And why are they self-contradicting?
 Is a definition and Synonyms of the Word Cham in Babiniotis dictionary enough to use as the definitive source of these statement:
The name """"Cham"""", together with that of the region, """"Chameria"""", is of uncertain origin. It may derive from the local Greek hydronym Thyamis (Θύαμις in Greek, Çam in Albanian) or from the ancient Thraco-Illyrian tribe of Sameis
 Why isn't this included in the article:
 Albanian Cham units also played an active part in the Holocaust in Greece. Mazower, Mark. Inside Hitler's Greece: The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44. Yale University Press, 1993, ISBN 0300089236.
 Are Arvanites Chams?
No per:
1. The Ottoman Empire and Its Successors, 1801-. William Miller. Souliotes, 'an admirable blend of Greeks and Hellenized Albanians (aka Arvanites)'
2. The Eve of the Greek Revival. Helen Angelomatis-Tsougarakis. Souliotes 'Christian Albanians who had intermixed with Greeks...the most obvious examples of gradual intergration of Albanians into the national conciousness of Greeks are they Ydraioi and the Souliots' (this means they are Arvanites, or are the Ydraioi Chams?)
3. Capodistria: the Founder of Greek Independence: The Founder of Greek Independence. Christopher Montague Woodhouse7 Souliotes, a tribe of Greeks from Epirus...' (in another book of the same author says of Albanian origin, so Arvanites)

Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because """"Maris"""" is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings """"as"""" or """"is""""). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something. Maybe someone could shed more light on Latvian policy on names, maybe in Latvia it is different than here in Lithuania, or maybe Latvianisation of name is for example required to get citizenship? I don't know here.

When comparisons of heart rate and life expectancy are adjusted for body weight in mammals, it appears that life span is pre-determined by the basic energetics of living cells. This inverse relationship between heart rate and life expectancy reflects an epiphenomenon in which heart rate is a marker for, or a determinant of, metabolic rate and energetic needs.

The metabolic rate is dependent on the physical activity, which in turn is related to, and likely determined by, heart rate itself. Regression analysis on a logarithmic scale between body mass and metabolic rate among animals yields a straight line with the same slope as that between body mass and heart rate.19 Therefore, there is a close link between temperature, metabolism, and heart rate, and the question is which is the primary control among these parameters? If heart rate determines the metabolic rate, it follows that a relationship between heart rate and life span exists in the entire animal kingdom including man.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 """"Jewish settlements"""" map 

I'm removing the """"Jewish settlements"""" map because it is hardly NPOV:
 The yellow area is unlabeled, but when viewed together with the partition map, one get the impression that the yellow area is all populated by Arabs. In fact, much of it (including the entire southern Negev) was virtually unpopulated. Overall, the map creates the impression that Palestine was an Arab land, with a tiny scattered Jewish community. In fact, as the text of the article states, the population was approximately 1/3 Jewish.
 It uses the term """"settlements"""", thus ignoring Jewish population living in the land for centuries in cities like Jerusalem, Safed, and Tiberias. Also, the term """"settlements"""" has gained certain connotations in recent years, since it's applied to Jewish population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Discussion of the Insane Guy's Is Not Worthy Enough To Devote the Entire First Paragraph To Him 

As outlined in my comments immediately above, Susan also argued with a man accusing Obama of being a fascist. Xeno attempted to devote the entire first paragraph to the little exchange she had with him - trying especially hard to make him, and hence the others, appear as dumb as possible. For instance, Xeno only included his statement """"because he is,"""" when in actually the (concededly insane and dumb) man said """"because he is . . . all of the politicians need 1 term limits . . . the pirates are in Washington."""" But I will adopt the wikipedia assumptions that everyone always says they comply with but really don't and go ahead and just assume Xeno acted in good faith. It must have just been a small mistake.
To the extent that her exchange with the first guy - and particularly, any """"clipping"""" of his statements - would be relevant, I would argue (and I could find support) that it would be relevant to the extent of showing the disparity of treatment with which Susan has shown liberals depicting Republican presidents as Hitler and conservatives depicting Democrat presidents as liberals.

As somewhat of an aside perhaps, don't get me wrong...I fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a Jewish community should become a part of that community, adopting its minhagim as his own.  This is the ruling according to Beth Yosef.  So, when Ashkenazim have settled there, they should have become an integral part of the Bukharan community, as Bukharans.  (The real """"aside"""" is the egregious nature of the establishment of the Rishon LeTziyon """"Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi"""" ba'aretz, in contravention of halakha.)  The reason I ask is because there seems to be a concentration on these individuals with apparently Russified names, if not originally Ashkenazim themselves, and the """"native Bukharans"""" apparently warrant no mention.  Did the Russian Jews that seriously dominate the locals, economically, or did the Bukharans Russify their surnames in order to ingratiate themselves to their Russian domineers?  That is the question I'm asking.  talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cu, I do not think it's so much a matter of translation as of using different recensions. All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to """"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter."""" And """"hereafter"""" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to """"Romanism"""" - in fact the British invented all this """"Joseph of Arimathea"""" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome. In this context I find it significant that David was made Archbishop in Jerusalem - and that this western Archbishopric has completely disappeared!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Len Metherell, who made his debut in 1930, see 6th Edition The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers, certainly used the drop punt, and indicated that he had learned it from his father. With the retirement of Dyer in 1949 the drop punt gradually fell into disuse. When Bartle, of Geelong, took a spectacular mark five meters from goal in 1958 and kicked a behind, the Geelong advertiser admonishes: he foolishly tried a drop punt. 3AW Book of Footy Records 1989 page195/6

Jack Dyer adapted the Collier Brothers of Collingwood’s Drop Punt, which they used as a short pass of around ten yards in place of a hand pass. They only used it to pass the ball to each other over the head of an opponent. See page 165, Jack Dyer Captain Blood as told to Brian Hanson, Paul, (London), 1965.

Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with """"probabilities"""". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say """"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"""". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, """"B"""" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if """"A"""" were a dead body and """"B"""" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, """"A"""", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed """"B"""". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

I noticed another issue that I guess it's not listed anywhere: when some articles start getting big and full of information, wikipedia users refrain from deleting weak or even nonsense parts. They believe it's good to keep all that (useless?) stuff, probably reasoning that some information is better than none. That's why many many articles get huge and are tagged to need the attention of an expert (who would hopefully clean up all the junk).

I strongly disagree with this behavior of keeping junk on the main page. I guess the editing system should allow two versions of an article: the main one, with the information that was agreed by everyone (intersection of information) and another, longer one with all the possible information for that subject (union of information). In this way people would not be so afraid of deleting junk because it would be stored on the second page, and the main article would always be a cleaned up version, which, if not complete, at least would not fail on quality.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Witness Brigish English, Mandarin (linguistics), Flemish (linguistics), Ashkenazi Hebrew, Cantonese (linguistics), American English, Sephardi Hebrew, etc etc... Arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by Wikipedia policy, therefore Arvanitic language or Arvanitika language are out of the question. I don't want to use Arvanitika Albanian as it will be too controversial (so i don't want Albanian in the title). Therefore, the only options are Arvanitic or Arvanitika. They can and should be used. Arvanitic has the majority vote, and therefore that shall be used. What is wrong with it? It is neutral. It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies. What UNESCO, Britannica etc say is assumed correct according to WP:V and WP:NOR. I am not labeling Arvanites Albanians against their will. Are we labeling the Irish English against their will by calling their language (Hiberno English) a dialect of English? No! So stop that straw man argument. Arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone AND has majority support here and will be used according to policy. The world is not made to please you, neither is Wikipedia.

I'm sorry to be blunt, but this just doesn't fly. Ruddiman's hypothesis is neither here nor there with regard to the cause of recent warming. If anything, it's logically inconsistent to argue that a small change in GHG in pre-industrial time did affect climate and yet a large change in GHG in the present day isn't affecting climate. And snowball earth was > 500 MYa, which is way outside any relevant time frame for current global warming (the continents were in completely different places, for a start).  Finally, Ruddiman himself would likely take exception to being thrown in with the """"scientists objecting..."""" camp  the fact that his latest book is """"Plows, Plagues, and Petroleum: How Humans Took Control of Climate"""" gives a hint as to his stance on recent warming.

Hi Parutakupiu, there's no """"disturbance""""!  Sorry for not replying on the WikiProject page - sometimes I have an immediate opinion on a topic and I will reply quickly, and sometimes I need to think about something, so I take some time.

In this case, I guess I'm not sure about your proposal.  The templates certainly look good, so there's no issue there, but I'm weighing the pros and cons of another set of navigation boxes.  I think there are instances on Wikipedia where proper use of categories and list pages are probably sufficient to navigate a topic, and other places where navigation boxes really are desired.  For example, many athlete pages have an excessive use of navigation boxes, in my opinion.  Take a look at Toni Sailer, for example.  At least those five navigation boxes now utilize the show/hide feature - that page was very cluttered before.  Even so, I'm not sure that it is a natural way for readers to want to navigate through Wikipedia.  Do we really need a navigation box to go from one winner in a specific event at the world championships to the next?  Wouldn't it be just as easy to have a """"See also"""" section with links to List of Olympic medalists in alpine skiing and List of Alpine Skiing World Champions and navigate from there?

It's not exactly a parallel situation, but perhaps the concept is similar  the question to be answered is do we really need this new set of navigation boxes (which will number around 350-400 if we make them for all events) or are a set of categories and the existing medalist lists sufficient?  I currently don't have a solid opinion on this myself, so I haven't offered one in response to your request on the WikiProject page.  However, if you have a logical position to support whichever path you take, and can lay the foundation for a consistent implementation across all events (not just diving), then I would support you either way.  Consistency is my biggest concern here.  Hope this helps,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The reason why this drama has been going on for months and months is a small group with no stake in the long run is making all the decisions for the contributors who do. This is why of the dozens of regular MMA contributors were part of this at the start, but now there are none. Think about that for a second. We can sit here all day and talk about consensus, but the way it's been going on in this case is fundamentally wrong.

98886a86c2960466,"By going through the websites I was capable of establishing a final evaluation for all the websites. I noticed that all four of the websites have a dark background (dark gray) and a light font on the writing (white). This makes it easier and clearer for people to read. Also, enlargement of the font would have made it more improved. In my opinion, leaving the whole text in all the websites in a normal font and not an italic font would be much more readable particularly to old people, and people who have sight problems. In addition, while looking into the data in the websites, you can clearly notice the politeness of the text which makes the websites suitable for people from all age groups. From searching the websites, I have observed the fact that there are completely no advertisements or commercials which help the reader to realize that the websites are reliable. Hence, some of the data entered in the websites are taken from unfair sources. For example, Graham Browely is the ex manager of the band, thus, he is expected not to be supporting the band and imply negative points concerning their new album. Also, Mike Jones is the current manager of the band; it is predictable of him to pronounce all the positive points about the band for the sake of advertising their new album. All websites are provided with quotations that are told by important people. It is essential for people who are interested in the subjects of the websites to also be interested in what important people have to say about the issue. This helps provide people with what they are looking for. I could not help but notice the link added on the end of the page in Mike Jones’ website which works perfectly well. This link is helpful for all people who are fans of Mike Jones and it leads them directly to his personal profile. Graham and Mike Jones’ websites show the date. It is apparent that Mike Jones’ website is more up to date than Graham’s. It is essential for a website to be up to date to stay interesting for the people viewing it. In my opinion, the most suitable website is the Joan Hoarse magazine website. The only thing that is missing is the date. The date gives the readers the feeling of loyalty that they are reading something that is new and interesting.

6e15cde097b60187,"Romanization 

Modified Hepburn romanization (as described below) should be used in all cases, excepting those cases where another romanization is determined to be in common usage in reliable sources.
Japanese terms should be romanized according to common usage in English-language reliable sources as indicated by policy, including unconventional romanization of titles and names by licensees (e.g., Devil Hunter Yohko and Tenjho Tenge—see below)—words used frequently in English (such as sumo or judo), the official English name for companies and organizations (e.g., Kodansha rather than Kōdansha, Doshisha University rather than Dōshisha University), or location names (e.g., Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Kyushu, Honshu, Hokkaido, Ryukyu Islands, Bonin Islands, Iwo Jima). The list of examples given here is not exhaustive. Redirects for all likely romanizations should be created to make sure people will be able to find the articles easily regardless of which form they use in their search.
To determine if the non-macronned form is in common usage in English-language reliable sources, a review should be done of all the related reliable sources used for the article (as well as any which may not have been specifically used, but can still be considered reliable per WP:RS). This may be redetermined periodically (generally no more often than semiannually) as usage changes over time and as new additional reliable sources become available. If it can not be determined whether the non-macronned form is in common usage in English-language reliable sources, then the macronned form should be used until such time as it can be determined.
If an article uses English-language reliables source and those sources use a particular form of romanization to name a topic, give preference to that romanization in the article title and body text. If an article uses only Japanese-language reliable sources, use the romanization given in them. If no romanization is given by the reliable sources used in an article, use modified Hepburn romanization. In all cases, the same romanization should be used for the article title and the body text (within that article and within the body text of other articles).
Please note that scholarly reliable sources (e.g., encyclopedias, academic journals, documentaries, and textbooks) and mainstream media (e.g., newspapers, magazines, and television reports) reliable sources are equally acceptable, and neither should be considered more valid than the other. However, more recent reliable sources should generally be given preference over older reliable sources, especially in topics and areas where current understanding may be more complete than older understanding (e.g., in science and technology).

Since this seems to have blown up spectacularly in my face, I might as well explain my edit. /

I came across this BLP, which hadn't been edited since last year, and noticed that the paragraph about her signing that creationism petition seemed a disjointed and tangential - her signing the petition is unquestionably notable, but it seemed jarring to go straight from discussion of her research to """"In February 2006, the New York Times reported... The petition, a two-sentence statement,"""" without stating why she signed the petition or anything. We have an essay about these sorts of articles and the problems with them - WP:COATRACK. I checked out her personal webpage, noticed she was quite open about her religion, googled """"Rosalind Picard christian"""" and found an Atlantic Monthly article that discussed at length why she was a creationist. So I added a sentence about that, making the article flow more smoothly into the signing of the petition. I also removed the second sentence explaining the petition, as I thought it was straying too off-topic.

I discussed this with Raul and can now see the merits of leaving that last sentence in - I think the article as it now stands is acceptable. What's greatly troubling to me is that instead of discussing this and working out a compromise, certain folks refused my invitation to discuss it and instantly jumped on me and started canvassing for a revert war when a few minutes of discussion would have cheerfully resolved the situation instead. (I'm personally as agnostic and anti-creationist as it gets... the only god I'm working in the name of here is WP:BLP.)

 Signpost exit poll  
Dear Wikipedian, you recently voted in the ArbCom election.  Your username, along with around 155 other usernames of your fellow Wikipedians, was randomly selected from the 2000+ Wikipedians who voted this year, with the help of one of the election-commissioners.  If you are willing, could you please participate (at your option either on-wiki via userspace or off-wiki via email) in an exit poll, and answer some questions about how you decided amongst the ArbCom candidates? 

  If you decide to participate in this exit poll, the statistical results will be published in the Signpost, an online newspaper with over 1000 Wikipedians among the readership.  There are about twelve questions, which have alphanumerical answers; it should take you a few minutes to complete the exit poll questionnaire, and will help improve Wikipedia by giving future candidates information about what you think is important.  This is only an unofficial survey, and will have no impact on your actual vote during this election, nor in any future election.  

  All questions are individually optional, and this entire exit poll itself is also entirely optional, though if you choose not to participate, I would appreciate a brief reply indicating why you decided not to take part (see Question Zero).  Thanks for being a Wikipedian

 The questionnaire  
Dear Wikipedian, please fill out these questions  at your option via usertalk or via email, see Detailed Instructions at the end of the twelve questions  by putting the appropriate answer in the blanks provided.  If you decide not to answer a question (all questions are optional), please put the reason down:  """"undecided"""" / """"private information"""" / """"prefer not to answer"""" / """"question is not well-posed"""" / """"other: please specify"""".  Although the Signpost cannot guarantee that complex answers can be processed for publication, it will help us improve future exit polls, if you give us comments about why you could not answer specific questions.

I can certainly handle that ) I was thinking of your """"stress"""" talk/post from a while back, I also pretty much quit editing after some highly fatiguing moments last year (in which I eventually prevailed through arbitration); on pages where you'd never have expected arguments! I am bilingual and binational in Canada, which makes my cultural sensitivities and awareness a little over the top. Add arrogant Frenchmen into the mix and it makes editing French pages extremely litigious and the same vein as certain brit/american/auz litigations on language use. Some days I think that each language wikipedia needs to invent a country/region specific tool because endless regionalisms in a single intro is heavy. Another source of litigation is overuse of internet references, often these pop culture science sites are rife with distorted or misinformation, for internet references I like to limit it to webpages which are themselves well referenced or science organizations vs virtual non contactable entities (of course, as an overeducated scientist, mostly I mean in context of scientific notions) or media pages (I distrust these most).

Broad search simply for the definition

Here are the defnitions that I found going through four google pages, only excluding repition and irrelevant sites.

Lawlor here identifies the exact problem I identified as being the major problem with this page. A page like this which strives for accuracy should acknowledge that there is no set definition (no """"majority"""", no consus) on how the term should be used:

""""Several key questions are central to the study of the Beat Generation. The first is whether a Beat Generation actually exists. If the Beat Generation consists of Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, and a few others, then the Beat Generation does not exist because a generation cannot be based on just a few people. On the other hand, if the Beat Generation includes dozens and dozens of artists, including not only writers but also dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, then the Beat Generation does not exist because the concept is too loose, too vague.""""

William Lawlor. Beat culture: lifestyles, icons, and impact. ABC-CLIO, 2005 
ISBN 1851094008, 9781851094004. pg. 78.

For this one, there may be some confusion by what Kerouac means by “people who had been beaten down” since that could apply to either the small group or the broader subculture. However, Morgan provides the same definition I presented earlier in which Kerouac identifies it as “certain members of the generation that came of age after World War II who affected detachment,” etc. It’s conceivable that one might argue Kerouac meant his group of friends by “certain people, but from many other sources, he meant the broader subculture (open for debate, but let’s have that debate instead of blindly dismissing without evidence to support counterclaims). Here’s the quote from Morgan:

“Once the press began to identify those writers collectively as ‘the Beat Generation,’ some within the group began to struggle with a definition for the word beat. Since it was Jack Kerouac who had originally coined the phrase, he was asked repeatedly what he meant by it. Initially he said that the Beat Generation was composed of people who had been beaten down, worn out, and exhausted. As time passed, he refined his definition to emphasize the beatific, blessed, or sympathetic qualities of his generation.”

Ahmadinejad never said that phrase, and what he was referring to, which was actually a statement of Ayatollah Khomeini roughly translates to """"[the usurping regime of Israel] should be eliminated from the page of the world""""  one could argue that a good translation for that phrase in English would be """"wiped off the map"""", but that is not what Khomeni had originally said.  Nonetheless, Ahmadinejad was referring to what Khomeini had said and the Western media (in my opinion, Zionist-controlled Western media) suddenly blew it way out of proportion, for obvious reasons.

Serbian casualties again

Just one link more, to the already existing ones numbered above: http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199711/71128-026-trae-beo.htm 
It is perfectly understandable for Serbian apologists to try to minimize the Serbian death toll (in battles- civilian Serbian casualties are, as usual, inflated beyond & beyond..). The reason ? High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence (as contrasted to their self-image of a Ramboid nation); also, it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia. Anyone's national sensibilities aside-it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death toll at the lowest level of 8.000.  

The article is signed by Stipe Sikavica (a typical Croatian name) so it again represents a Croatian press POV.

Here's another nice example of nationalist logic. What you're basically saying is that this journalist cannot possibly be objective because he is Croatian, is that it? Infact, you are drawing this conclusion solely out of the man's NAME. What if he changed his name, maybe he would be more neutral then, what do you think?  

Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10.000.
According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the number often mentioned is 2,300., and most of them, around a half, are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar. The cited article states also that """"most experts agree with the figure"""". 
There are no reason to put 8.000 or 10.000 as official data. These data are contraversial. 
Croatian sources, ie. general Anton Tus, put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10.000. Other sources, like brigadier general Mile Dedaković, in his book """"Bitka za Vukovar"""", put the highest limit around 12.000. Therefore, chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties. This page is not about what Serbian sources say-exclusively. Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle, the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say. And, in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica, it is clear for anyone who is not deaf, blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus's estimates. It is explicit. Therefore, reverted.  

I've seen this later

It's not just the number of Serbian military casualties (after all, these were mainly puzzled conscripts sent to the slaughterhouse). It's this sick worldview prevalent in some Serbian circles: Croatian paramilitaries, secession, liberation of Vukovar,...then liberation of Srebrenica, faked Markala, lies about everything and everyone (for those conversant with Croatian, just a slice: http://www.hic.hr/books/jugoistocna-europa/dedijer.htm#kraj%20mita).

Mario Template

Hey, just wanted to leave a note explaining the  's in the template. They help with formatting and keeping the title names from splitting (they also keep the dashes from wrapping and starting a line). BTW, as far as the Mario Kart games go, part of me thinks you were on the right track, maybe the Mario Kart template should be folded into the Mario series template.

The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:

""""Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections. Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question """"Do you want to turn the Government out?"""" said """"Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns."""" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

>>Thus whereas the Jesus article has 90% images of Jesus, the Muhammad article has only 30% images of which 20% are contentious and would have been edit-warred over. It would seem to be an unrepresentative view to simply remove the last few images from the article.

My answer: 
Jusus article has 100% images of Jesus which are accepted/used/associated about Jesus in 90% of Christianians.

Muhammad article 100% images of Muhammad which are accepted/used/associated about Muhammad in 0.1% of Muslims as well as nonmuslims in all the history. 

There is not even a single mosque having the image of Muhammad hanged and represented, which proves that the image in wikipedia article is purely a POV for few people who argue about the image that it is related to some 'unknown' painter and was used in a short span of history.

Use of the image having no source and no creator, is the violation of wikipedia images policy and not my personal opinion.

If there is an image which represents and is associated to Muhammad in mainstream Muslims/nonMuslims then use it. If there is no such image then it does NOT imply that you put some non-representing image or you put some image which is not associated to Muhammad by Mainstream Muslims/nonmuslims but by very few people in a short span of history.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Go back even 40 years and you can't find an Israeli politician saying """"we should attack the Arabs if we think we can win."""" That's just absurd and you know it. There are tons of times the Palestinian leadership has talked out both sides of their mouths, starting with Arafat's old """"Phased Plan"""" (establish """"Palestine"""" the state, THEN attack Israel). 

Question: How do you explain that you occasionally ask the Palestinian street not to explode? 
Arafat: When the prophet Muhammad made the Khudaibiya agreement, he agreed to remove his title """"messenger of Allah"""" from the agreement. Then, Omar bin Khatib and the others referred to this agreement as the """"inferior peace agreement."""" Of course, I do not compare myself to the prophet, but I do say that we must learn from his steps and those of Salah a-Din. The peace agreement which we signed is an """"inferior peace"""". The conditions [behind it] are the intifada, which lasted for seven years. 

Q: For practical reasons, do you now suggest to maintain quiet despite everything? 

Arafat: Yes, I suggest we maintain quiet. We respect agreements the way that the prophet Muhammad and Salah a-Din respected the agreements which they signed.  - That was from Orbit TV, April 18, 1998. The """"Khudaibiya"""" peace and the example of Saladin he speaks of are times when Islamic treaties were cut short because Muslim groups were just using them to build up their forces and lull the enemies into thinking war wasn't coming.

We signed that agreement in Oslo, and if any of you has one objection to it, I have one hundred objections. - that was Arafat in 1995 on Voice of Palestine radio, right after he again compared the Oslo accords to the Khudaibiya """"truce.""""

History 

OldLady Productions was created in 2007, by their first 2 actors Ryan and Marco. They created OldLady Productions after their first video """" Soccer Battle 2 """".
OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

Videos 

We do not know that exact amount of videos that OldLady Productions has due to the fast that they are still under construction. Here are a list of videos we are sure they have released 

- Soccer Battle 2

- The Prisoner
- Hero Movie
- THE FIGHT OF A LIFETIME ! ! ! ! !

- Fashion Show 08
- Ryan V.S Marco ( part 2 )
- Effects of Bullying
- What happens when you don't play fair !

- Detective Movie
- Camp Rock
- How to be a bro !
- Music Battle 2008
- Never Back Down ( training video ) * Parody *
- Chriss Angel
- James Bond

These movies were done for amusement purposes, before OldLady Productions commenced their actual company videos. OldLady productions is planning to create and unveil new and improved movies, starting with * Soccer Battle 3 * You may only be able to see all these videos on the official OldLady productions website. Most of these videos will not be on youtube because they are starting their big outbreak with Soccer Battle 3.

As you know, you have recently posted two vandalism warnings on my user talk page.  Please stop.  I have not been vandalizing anything on Wikipedia, but making good faith edits.  I once had an administrator caution me about bringing false charges of vandalism.  He said:

Now to answer your concern about vandalism reporting: vandalism is the kind of edit that no one should have a disagreement about.  Here are a couple of examples of true vandalism:   .  Edits other people want to make and you don't like are not vandalism, and it's a kind of incivility, if not a downright personal attack to describe someone's good faith edits as vandalism.

Thanks for that careful analysis.  I have a suggestion (though I'm not especially familiar with Amway/Aticor/Quixtar I have read and edited many articles). As an encyclopedia it is best if our articles report on what was as well as what is. So rather than changing the old label to the new label, or vice versa, it be better to write a history that essentially says, """"When the company started it was like this. Then it was like this. As of 1999, it is now like this."""" It sounds like the 1999 reorganization deserves a section or at least a major paragraph, while right now it gets just two sentences (there may also be some other bits and pieces that can be moved). May I also suggest that you be bold and do the edit yourself? There may be some websites in the list of links that can provide sources. Cheers, - 23:37, July 9, 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not just because of Sapphic's loss of temper that I'm suggesting a break, although it certainly plays a part.  I really think more progress would be made (in arriving at a community decision supported — and enforced — by ArbCom, as well as in getting the injunction lifted) if the named parties all removed themselves from the situation.

As for my comments about your son, I did NOT mean to imply that his trying out to be a SEAL was important to you and nobody else.  If I'd meant that, I'd have written it that way.  I don't like sarcasm or veiled insults, and prefer the more direct variety.  If I'm not writing mean things to you, then you can be sure I'm not thinking mean thoughts about you when I write whatever I do write.  I think in at least that one aspect of things, we have pretty similar views, and I definitely respect you for being able to shrug off insults.

I'm not posting anything to any of the dates-related pages for at least a week, I'm fairly sure I'll be able to convince Sapphic to do the same, and hopefully Locke Cole will follow suit.

My concern about your username (Admiinship is no big deal)

Hello, , and thank you for contributing to Wikipedia!

I hope not to seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your own views, for instance your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

You have several options freely available to you:
 If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it.
 If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a """"third opinion"""", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians. Admins usually abide by agreements reached through this process.
 You can keep your contributions history under a new username. Visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the guidelines there.

Let me reassure you that my writing here means I don't think your username is grossly, blatantly, or obviously inappropriate; such names get reported straight to Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism (WP:AIV), or blocked on sight. This is more a case where opinions might differ, and it would be good to reach some consensus — either here or at WP:RFC/NAME. So I look forward to a friendly discussion, and to enjoying your continued participation on Wikipedia. Thank you again! addict  addict """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. - 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 For willmcw 

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. - 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, """"Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade."""" Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.

DavidWBrooks, I would suggest that if you have spent a month intensively editing the iridology entry, it's possible you feel emotionally-invested in the task. It may be better for all if you turn your efforts to more fruitful and productive entries, instead of continually trying to add """"con"""" to this """"pro"""" entry. It was recently pointed out to me that some of my editions to the big bang entry were inappropriate, because an entry for a subject is the place to support the subject, not to tear it down. The suggestion was made to me that I move my proposed editions to where they would be appropriate, in """"non-standard cosmology"""" entries. I now make this suggestion to you. If you seek to criticize iridology, you should not do it in the entry meant to explain and support iridology. Perhaps you can make an entry titled """"non-standard iridology"""" or maybe even """"fringe theories about iridology"""" if you want to challenge the mainstream iridologists.

 asked for a third-party opinion, so here goes:
 This long-running discussion makes me think of a few things in general:
 Michael is a newby, so the wiki policy of don't bite the newbies seems to be relevant, and it looks like for the most part,  is sticking to that, apart from personal comments about Michael's English. I can relate to the fact that it is sometimes hard to figure out what someone's point is, and that may be what Kwami was trying to say about Michael, but I think it's out of line to say that someone's English is non-native, or that someone's knowledge of Arabic is similarly less than desirable. So my point on this one is this: stick to the point and leave personal comments out.
 Sometimes, discussions about articles and edits get pretty heated, even without personal comments. If you can't handle it, take a wikibreak. This is what I do, and it works for me.
 Divide up the topics for discussion - it makes it much easier for people to comment without having to read lots and lots of stuff they aren't interested in. For example, if I want to comment about /el/ and /ba'al/, where in that long discussion would I want to put my comment?
 I think one of the best things that can be done for this article is to divide it up. Put the meat of the Wadi al-Hol in an article by itself, and the Proto-Sinaitic script information in its own page. What remains of the Middle Bronze Age alphabets is a general summary of why these two are thought to be related, plus thumbnail sketches of the content of those two articles, with appropriate Main Article type links. I think this will focus the discussion. For example, if Colliss has written about one but not the other, all refutation and support of Colliss's arguments will be guided to the right discussion pages.
 This topic is one of many that has scholars screaming at each other. There are ways of summarizing the opposing arguments that allow casual readers to understand the controversy without getting information overload.
 In relation to both of these scripts, the article suffers from a dearth of citations, appropriate or otherwise. The various assertions are interesting and serve as a stepping-off point for finding the actual sources, so I would oppose the deletion of every single unsupported citation. After all, it was only a few years ago that Wikipedians started to insist on citations - before then, there was a whole lot of original research, some of which still persists without proper citations.
 I for one would like to know how many examples of these inscriptions have been found. From the current state of this article, it seems like there is only one of proto-Sinaitic (which was found in two locations, which can't be right) and that there are only two Wadi al-Hol inscriptions, which we can see in the illustration provided. There is also a citable reference in some National Geographic website about Semitic anti-snake inscriptions in part of Unas's tomb in Giza. Maybe that should have its own page, too, with an appropriate link.
 I don't buy this business about Arabic being irrelevant. It reminds me too much of how European researchers dismissed all Arabic scholarship about the Arabic language itself. However, any references to Arabic in an article on a topic from the Middle Bronze Age have to keep in mind the huge time difference. For example, the hamza was a much later development, so it sheds about as much light on Wadi al-Hol as the development of the letters J, V and W.
 I don't accept the table at all - the article is about an intermediate step that is not represented in the table. The table represents conjecture about connections between two known endpoints, Hieroglyphic and the Semitic alphabet (for lack of a better term). Besides, if the hypothesis is that the proto-Sinaitic script evolved from hieratic writing, then why is that script not represented in the table?
 I don't accept the business of naming these letters. Unless there is evidence to show that these symbols even had names at the time they were used, the names are anachronistic. If the names were in fact attested at a different time in a different script, the person promoting the use of the names has a big burden. In terms of Wikipedia, all we have to do is say that a particular citable scholar has made the connection, and if the connection is disputed, we can point to a citation that says that too. It is our own editorial discretion that says how we portray that dispute, for example,
 A says X, but others disagree, for example, B.
 It is not clear whether X is true, as claimed by A, or whether Y is true, as claimed by B.
 Scholars disagree on whether X is tr",0,0,0,0,0,0

Well I can tell you something that bugs me so bad about my sisters and their friends.
They lie about EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! And they always get away with it.
For example, my sister threw a shoe at me, it slammed into my face and she claimed it hit me in the stomach. How the crap would she know? She wasn't the one that got hit.
Anyways, when they lie they do get away with it. Which is why I'm going to answer this question now. 

Girls lie so they don't have to get in trouble, girls hate getting in trouble and then they rebel when they get grounded and a lot of fighting goes on. Also they'd always rather have their friend or another person in trouble but them. So take this for example, Tashya (made up the name) does something bad. And she knows she'll get in trouble for it. So when her mom or dad finds out she blames it on her brother. And her brother gets yelled at and grounded for her fault. Girls also love it when other people get in trouble.

According to former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, in his book By Way of Deception, the Mossad """"was deeply involved with several other warring Lebanese families, paying for information, passing it between groups, even paying the gangs and some Palestinians in the refugee camps for intelligence and services. Besides Gemayel, both the Jumblatt and Berri families were on the Mossad payroll. Source: Ostrovsky, Victor (1990). By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer, p. 316

Berri is involved in corruption allegations regarding a 1996 coastal motorway in southern Lebanon. The contract for the motorway was won by a firm run by Berri's wife, Randa Assi, and was said to be overpriced by over three hundred million US dollars. Sources: Johnson, Michael (2001). All Honorable Men: The Social Origins Of War In Lebanon , p.236; Schwerna, Tobias (2010). Lebanon: A Model of Consociational Conflict , p.128. 

In 2004, Berri was mentioned in several of the diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks. One cable said that Amal is """"near universally derided as corrupt to the core"""", and that Berri was described by a relative of Musa al-Sadr as having provided social services in the south only through """"wheeling, dealing, and stealing"""". Also according to the cables, Berri receives USD 400,000 a month from Iran, using a fourth of the sum to shore up his support and pocketing the rest. Sources: Gloria Center, Wikileaks cables. 

According to one source, Berri was considered by Rafik Hariri to be """"irredeemably corrupt and unreliable"""", as well as an opportunist, and is thought to maintain his support base through access to state funds. Source:  Blanford, Nicholas (2006). Killing Mr. Lebanon: The Assasination of Rafik Hariri and Its Impact on the Middle East , p. 118

According to leaked diplomatic cables, during the 2006 Lebanon war, Berri, publicly an ally of Hezbollah, described Israel's attacks on Hezbollah to US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman as being """"like honey"""", and hoped that Israel would complete its mission against Hezbollah quickly. He suggested that the IDF """"markedly improve its targeting intelligence to make air strikes more effective. Either that, or they would have to wipe Hizballah out of the south with a ground offensive."""" He also suggested that """"if Israel succeeds in weakening Hizballah militarily, then he will be more willing to weaken them politically"""". Sources: Wikileaks cables, NOW Media, Aspen Institute, Middle East Online. 

Berri's sister-in-law and close business associate Samira Assi, is said to have made a fortune by getting a contract from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to print one million copies of Gaddafi's """"Green Book"""". Assi's deals are seen as highly controversial, since the founder of the Amal Movement, Musa al-Sadr, is known to have been disappeared on the orders of Gaddafi himself.

Nobody has said anything so I started a bit. I cleaned up the header and expanded academics and student life. I also tried to make the language sound a bit more formal. 

Academic program still needs to be expanded to include things like internships and study abroad. (Or should that go in student life?) I also still want to add traditions, campus buildings, and more photos. I was thinking about shortening the section on student housing. It seems disproportionately large and not necessarily that important to have details on every single dorm. Thoughts on this?

I don't know much about the history or athletics of the ollege, but I'm guessing this could use some work too. Maybe someone who knows more about it could expand on those sections.

The notable alumni section could use a lot of cleaning up. I think the list of alumni on the main page should include maybe 10 people in a neatly organized bullet point list. Right now it is a mess to read. Any other alumni can be mentioned on the separate list of Macalester people.

I feel that I have to add something. Please note that the temporary solution defines Kosovo as a territory of Serbia and Montenegro under UN administration. Note that it's not defined as a part of Serbia, but the Union rather. This is mostly because they anticipated the future most probable status of Kosovo, a state within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. 

However, you must realize that Serbia's (and the Union's) consitution defines Kosovo as an autonomous region, temporary under UN administration. The current borders of Serbia (and SCG) are internationally recognized and used everywhere (with Kosovo-Metohija). However, Kosovo is nowhere treated as an entity indistinct from Serbia (and most definatly not indistinct from the S-M), as no faction in the world sees it that way. I suggest that a possible compromise is that we should add that the Kosovar Albanian goverment refuses the Belgrade suzeiranity and considers it not a part of Serbia, and then the other side of the story (Serbia & the world), however, pointing it not an official part of Serbia and Montenegro is, francly, I apologize for the expression, but it is, really nonsensical.

SkagitRiverQueen making unfounded accusations
I have had to deal with this person continually since before Christmas. Someone posted questionable content to her talk page, whereupon she intitiated an unfounded sock case against me at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Wildhartlivie/Archive. Then she filed a report here about me. Next she popped up at Black Dahlia, an article upon which she had never previously edited, to revert something I removed and has maintained a overly long, ridiculously drawn out discussion with editors there. At one point, Crohnie admonished her for treating her like """"an idiot or something"""". Next she popped up at Charles Manson, also an article upon which she had not previously edited, to throw herself into an issue I was involved in and making unsupported statements, which she has proceeded to edit war over. She then joined WP:CRIME, a project in which I'm active. It is quote obvious she is stalking my edits. Finally tonight, another editor came to Talk:Black Dahlia to enter a content vote, and SkagitRiverQueen made an outright accusation against me of canvassing votes, where she clearly and unequivocably said """"It's obvious that some editors have been canvassed specifically to sway the vote (and am I making an accusation here? yes, indeed, I am)."""" I asked her to withdraw her comment and her response was """"And, frankly, regardless of whether or not I can prove it, I don't believe that you *haven't* canvassed for input here."""" She was clearly challenged on this by LaVidaLoca here and Pinkadelica here. I want this editor to stop following me around, picking tenditious arguments and making specious and unfounded accusations against me. Wildhartlivie (talk) 

I endorse these comments by Wildhartlivie. I object to the specious claim that my opinion was canvassed in anyway and believe SkagitRiverQueen's intent is tenditious and assaultive in nature. For the record, she has reverted the Manson article 3 times, even after she was asked not to edit war over it. It appears to me that she is wikihounding Wildhartlivie and would take exception to anything she says or does. This is an untenable situation that needs to stop. LaVidaLoca (talk)  
As the editor who instigated the preliminary consensus vote (and as such a possible cohort in the WP:CANVASS), I must agree that this claim against Wildhartlivie is specious and unwarranted. I have attempted to instruct SkagitRiverQueen on the proper way to engage in disputes (mainly not attacking other editors based on perceived editing style). This has not worked as of yet. I do see a pattern of """"wikihounding"""" here on SkagitRiverQueen's part, as do many other editors, and this has persisted for some time. This feud must end... Doc9871 (talk)  
IMO, this is purely retaliation by Wildhartlivie for the sock-puppet investigation (exactly why it's the first thing she mentioned in the complaint even though the issue has been over and done for nearly a couple of weeks, now). Not only is she reverting practically everything I have edited recently, she is now reverting entire sections of large articles I have edited[18]. On top of that, she continues to call me by an inflammatory name (""""Skag"""" - I have noted on my User Page it is *not* an acceptible contraction of my user name; she even mentioned earlier today that she has read that admonition on my user page[19] that is a known slang term for women who have less than savory reputations[20]). Now, in addition to everything else, she has placed an """"edit war"""" warning on my talk page *after* she filed this report.[21] I am not in an edit war - and am actually trying to reason with the editor of that article who has been reverting my recent edits.[22] Wildhartlivie has publically called my mental and emotional health into question here in Wikipedia on more than one occasion. Additionally, she has a questionable history that includes abuse of her rollback privileges (see User talk:Wildhartlivie for the warning she recently received and User talk:GTBacchus for her responses to the warning), continued incivility to anyone who edits articles she watches, and canvassing her Wikipedia friends to back her up whenever her edits or actions are called into question (above content from LaVidaLoca is proof of this). And yes, I do believe she canvassed editors by email regarding the issue we have been discussing at Talk:Black Dahlia. Concerning this complaint, you will likely also hear from User:Doc9871, User:Pinkadelica, User:Crohnie, User:Rossrs, User:Vidor, and User:Equazcion - all editors she has canvassed in the past when she feels she needs support in one of her efforts to prove me wrong. Evidence of this can be found at [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In those instances, she out-and-out lied that I mentioned four of those editors in any fashion - yet, her",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Sorry, WilyD, but re-stating a flawed argument doesn't validate it. You're starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made """"American"""" an understood term for """"from the United States"""" in most countries """"American"""" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term """"Americano"""" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you've implied """"America"""" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn't mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don't share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you're trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn't count) then """"rest-of-the-world"""" views are perfectly acceptable. This page exists, in part, to make it clear that """"American"""" is not always a demonym of the USA and this is a fact. As much a fact as U.S. citizens believen it does.

 Wikipedia's lying liars & their lies...  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute.

The widely used and agreed format is that for any organization listing particularly notable alumni, members, ect. in the article is OK; however, simply listing people for the sake of listing them dosen't add any meaningful content to the article as, unless the person is notable, then why would anyone else care about it.  Wikipedia is not a directly for simply listing information.  """"Notable"""" is quite universally agreed to mean that the individual is important enough to have their own entry in Wikipedia.  So if the person isn't important enough to independently warrant their own biographical page then it's simply irrelevent to list their name in the article as having once been associated with an organization.  

In regards to the above comment attempting to establish 'notability': Being mentioned in a local student run newspaper hardly counts, in its own right, as credible evidence for establishing that someone is notable enough for the rest of the world to know, or even care, who they are.  There is some precedent for establishing a chronological 'list' catagory, separate from the article itself, for long established offices or other leadership positions when that list would contain a number of notable indivduals (see above) with links to their biograpical articiles.  In such cases, there isn't much harm in filling in the list with 'non-notable' individuals for the sake of continuity.  However, in this case as this is still a very new organization and none of the names are, yet, notable it dosen't really make much sense nor does it add any meaningful content.  Perhaps is 30 years when, potentially, some former Berry leaders have gone on to notable careers such a list would be justified, but at the moment it would essentially just consitute pointless self promotion (citing the above previous concerns that this article appears to have been mostly written by those directly associated with the topic of the article).

I'm disputing it, based on considerable experience with PCs sold as complete PCs. I'm talking in particular about the models that are installed on the high tens of millions of corporate desktops in the US alone. PS/2 ports are like hen's teeth in that environment and these machines vastly outsell motherboards sold as components or high-end PCs sold to gamers. 

 Re. consensus, it is most decidedly not a """"numbers game."""" WP:CONSENSUS is not based on voting, but on logical arguments: 
Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy.

 See also WP:NOTDEMOCRACY: 

Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy or any other political system. Its primary (though not exclusive) means of decision making and conflict resolution is editing and discussion leading to consensus—not voting.

 And as for consensus vs. policies, see again WP:CONSENSUS:

Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale. For instance, unless they can convince the broader community that such action is right, participants in a WikiProject cannot decide that some generally accepted policy or guideline does not apply to articles within its scope.

 In short: Nobody has presented a RS for your claim, so it doesn't matter how many people agree with you.

Ruling of the Hague tribunal in 1931, that Lithuania does not have to allow Polish transit through Lithuanian territory, only proved the status quo. I'm not sure, but as much I do remember, Hague ruled this, declaring Poland as aggressor in Vilnius case. To make sure I'll need to check my books. 
Lithuanian government did understand, that after the coup there was small possibility, that Poland would use the coup to justify aggression against Lithuania. It seems Pilsudski did also understand that as a possibility. In his diaries there is a record from 1927: """"could  not sleep all night, considered whether to attack Lithuania"""".

My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006.

I'm not sure if you are Spyros Sofos or just a fan of his but Wikipedia is not a blog to promote the personal political views of Mr. Sofos and/or his associates.  I say this because your posting history here seems to reflect a cheerleading mentality towards Mr. Sofos rather than accepting that everyone can also be criticized for their views.

A couple of myths you believe that I'd like to clear up.

a. Spyros Sofos makes it clear that he does not see himself related to ancient Greeks in his works. Despite confusion over using similar nomenclature this effectively means his use of the word """"Greek"""" is of non-ethnic Greek context. Mr. Sofos see's national/ethnic identities as """"imagined communities"""".  (and not only Greeks  he deconstructs Turkish identity as well). While he is allowed to have a philosophical point of view, he can't have his proverbial cake and eat it too. He's a Greek citizen but not an ethnic Greek.

b. Spyros Sofos is certainly criticized by the far right in Greece but this point obfuscates its not just the far right that criticizes him. For instance, Mr. Sofos uses the word """"Macedonia"""" to describe the former Yugoslav republic is criticized by Greeks of all political persuasions (including both moderate left and right parties). His  narration of history is also criticized by Greeks of all political affiliations for casually dismissing Greek themes present since antiquity.

Since the corners are affected by the move F like

F = {1, 2, 3, 4} {5} {6} {7} {9}

the sequence FRBL does

FRBL = {1, 7} {2, 4} {3, 6} {5, 8}

that is, four 2-cycles so FRBL2 will return the corners to their original combination (ignoring twists - for now).  For the edges,

FRBL = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12} {4, 10, 7}

a 9-cycle and a 3-cycle.  The lowest common multiple (LCM) of a 9-cycle and a 3-cycle is a 9-cycle, hence the edges will be returned to their original combination by FRBL9 (ignnoring flips).

The LCM of a 2-cycle and a 9-cycle is a 18-cycle hence 

M = FRBL18 (72 moves)

is required to return both corners and edges to their original combination.  However, if they do not return with the correct twists and flips (haven't checked, can't be bothered, too much effort, but I seem to remember - from my now highly unreliable memory - that when I actually tried this move over 30 years ago it did twist and flip) then the sequence will have to be repeated to correct this.

I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0,0,0,0,0,0

(copied from request for checkuser)
Um, how long should I expect to wait? Progress on the entire set of articles is on hold pending the outcome of this checkuser.  
This is ridiculous. I'm here trying to create a better encyclopedia and this is the support I get? Hell of a turn off.  
While there are about 1000 administrators on wikipedia, only 14 of them have checkuser permission and 99% of the cases here are answered by just two of them, so you may have to be patient.  No article is so important that the sky will fall if it is stuck in the """"wrong version"""" for a few more days.  You can try a request for comment on the article to get some outside opinions if the usual editors can't agree.  
Sounds like this system is broken. Only 2 of the 14 people actually do the work? Time to replace some people. Or put some kind of disclaimer that this isn't very timely. Something to let people know not to expect results.  

 I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with that kind of abuse.  (talk) 

How about judging it on it's merits rather than your personal feelings?  

, seconded in the strongest possible terms. And CovenantD blocked for 24 hours for disruption.  (Talk) 
I'm just coming into this, but that seems more than a little harsh. Can't wikipedia have operational disagreements without assuming it's personal attacks, resulting in blocks? Or is there something outside this discussion I'm not seeing? -T-C 

I think the cascade of abusive comments directed at the checkusers were more than enough justification for blocking for disruption; common sense says you don't come ask for help and then start taking swings at the people you're asking for help. By the way, just for future note by anyone watching, the reason that it takes a while to get a response is because we have to deal with things like this; if people were, you know, patient/pleasant/appreciative, then we might be a bit more inclined to run checks. As it stands, we gain very little but constant abuse from all sides for volunteering our time to do this.  (Talk) 

Anyone else going to accept; it would be nice to see requests being upheld on the merit of the case rather than the behaviour of the applicant.   Talk

Speedy deletion of Gjendemsfjellet
 A tag has been placed on Gjendemsfjellet requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I'd like to clarify my concerns with the current version of the article, following the reversion of some of my edits by Stirling Newberry.

My general concern is that it doesn't accurately describe the debate about various causes of hyperinflation.  The article seems to me to be describing a stereotyped view of each side of the debate, which exagerrates the amount of controversy and obscures the amount of common ground.  """"Monetary"""" and """"Crisis of confidence"""" explanations of hyperinflation are describes as if they are two completely different competing theories,  held by different schools of thought (""""monetarists"""" and """"neo-liberals"""").

I think that the overwhelming majority of economists would see both monetary and confidence factors as being important as the initial 'root cause' of hyperinflation, with the importance varying from case to case.  A lot of the economics is very uncontroversial. For example:
It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position.
It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.

I would be interested to hear from Stirling what specific inaccuracies were in my edits, and why he deleted the statement """"The two models are closely related, and often economists may explain hyperinflation as being due to a combination of both effects.""""

On further reflection either number is quite small and perhaps the """"stat"""" should be expressed in such a way so as to convey the fact the proportion of offenders was small but nonetheless their effect was significant on both the Church and the victims. Albatross2147 (talk) 

The mention of the sex abuse scandals in the lead has been quite controversial, and it has been my position that putting them there at all constitutes WP:UNDUE weight, but that since most people read more newspapers than books, many editors will try to add ill-formed sentences of dubious accuracy saying something about them in the lead, and to prevent that, even though it violates WP:UNDUE, we should put a brilliantly prosaic, well-referenced, NPOV sentence there.  You are welcome, of course, to contribute, but any change in the lead should probably be mentioned on the talk page.  It might also help to know that the RCC article recently went through a very contentious FA review, which it failed, so there are a number of editors who know the article pretty well right now, and might be able to help address your concerns adequately.

Hi Greg Jack,

I saw what you put in the Amirite Article Debate

Only some of the articles I have quoted are Press releases. This one for example is certainly not a paid release: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/share-opinions-online-amiritenet-amirite/ Makeuseof is a very well known site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakeUseOf

I don't think the killerstartups article is a paid release since it doesn't mention adversarial on it. Also Amirite's twitter has over 62,000 followers which is significant: https://twitter.com/amiritecom And if you type Amirite.com and Amirite.net into google this brings more than 5 million results. This is significant.

Is there any chance you might re-consider your vote since this is my first article and it would be a shame to have it deleted, especially sinc I really hope it isn't since I'm a big fan of Amirite,

Cameron Ward DJ
Bold textCameron Ward is a little known radio DJ who is only of 16 years of age.  He first started his career on Millside hospital radio as a member of the 'Jan and Jules' show team and broadcasted every thursday night from 6pm-9pm.  He then struck out a solo career and moved to ashfield community radio where he had three different shows over 2 years.  These were 'Saturday sport' which broadcast saturdays 5pm-7pm, 'LIVE MID MORNING SATURDAY/SUNHDAY' (depened which day it was) between 9am and 12 midday.  Finaly he teamed up with nina squires to do the 'Super Sports Saturday Show' between 2pm and 6pm.  He then left ashfield comunity radio in late 2005 to move to 'Regency FM' which broadcast on the internet.  There he ran a show on saturday mornings 10am-1pm 'The Saturday Revolution Show',  Which grew a cult following across north east derbyshire and bangor in Wales.  Then sadly Regency Radio closed down due to lack of funds.  It is speculated Cameron will move back to ashfield community radio or to Trust Fm which has now aquired a FM licence to broadcast across chesterfield and north east derbyshire.

 NPOV again 

First of all, I'm Brazilian and PRO Lula. I want a more neutral article. Not all the people in Brazil, I know, like him. But not all the people hate him. Every one knows what NPOV means, it would be rather a Multiple Point of view. So, criticism and good things must come together. Althou, Wikipedia cannot agree with bias, hate or fanatism.
Here is a list of some alterations I made and a bit of opinion:

 Biography: it is alright. It is a standart biography...
 Elections... """"In the second round of the 2002 election, (...) and became the president of Brazil."""" instead of """"to become the president-elect of Brazil"""". Just a bit of grammar.3
 The Government - Political Orientation: some time before, I transfered a piece of text about the radical-left-wing of PT from this article to PT's article. I DID NOT DELETED it. I just put it in a better place, because it is not a personal problem of Lula, but a problem for the party. Every one agree? The external links about it i tranfered to PT's article, too.
 The Government - Reforms and Important Laws. When I first wrote it I put each item as a section (I was pretending to write a piece of text for each one). It was oversized and so, following a sugestion, I changed it in a list. All right?
 Deleted: """"Unfortunately, there has been no control over the program on behalf of the government and """"Bolsa Família"""" has been transformed into mere populism."""" - It is not the common sense. It is a political point of view of an action of the government. Populism is a dangerous word that must be avoided. Maybe we could use another phrase instead, like it: """"Althou, there is some criticism on the efficency of this project."""".

 Naji al-Ali 

Hi Ian,

I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938. What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is """"Sulaiman al-Shaikh - """"The caricature artist Naji al-Ali"""" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection."""" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.

On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying """"I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.""""

However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.

Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.

By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

GWH, I tried e-mailing you during my block to discuss this, but you refused to respond. So let's discuss it right here on your User Talk page, now that my block has expired. I agree that my use of the word """"thug"""" deserved a block. 

I deserved it. I apologize. 

I will never allow myself to be baited into a violation of WP:NPA and WP:CIVIL again.

However, you are making a WP:POINT of ignoring more blatant violations by other editors, such as . The diffs posted above, and his conduct at ANI both in October and yesterday, are textbook examples of baiting. The """"school of piranha"""" analogy is appropriate. You are a walking case of selective enforcement. Like BU,  deserves to be blocked for his edit warring and does not deserve the benefit of the doubt for his sockpuppetry, due to the edit warring context in which it occurred, and his failure to immediately claim the IP puppet's edit as his own. But you won't do it.

I believe we should find the proper venue to discuss your selective enforcement of Wikipedia policy, specifically addressing your abuse of admin privileges to support editors you like and block editors you don't like (because they resist POV pushing and edit warring by editors you like). Would you be so kind as to point us in the right direction? I'll enlist people like ,   and CoM to help me gather all the diffs (since they've all had previous encounters with BU and LotLE, and know where the """"bodies"""" are buried), and we'll examine your selective enforcement practices in detail.

Or would you prefer to go forward with an investigation of the editing patterns of people like LotLE and BU, and decide fairly on the subject of blocking them? I could go either way at this point. You decide. Skoal   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example """"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"""". To conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism, I suggest we cut it from the text of this page, and maybe just add a """"see also"""" pointing to the other page.

 Followup on Abed Khan article 

Salaam,
I last posted here over two years ago about the English Abed Khan article after I noticed that you had written on the talk page. I've finished sourcing nearly all the claims in the article, but I am missing a bit of information and I had a quick question for you. The section about Khan's broadcast of Jobab Dao in Kolkata is an important one. However, I cannot find any English-language sources for these facts at all! (I have scoured hundreds of Google search results for """"abed khan"""", to no avail.) I was wondering whether the Bengali-language Abed Khan article had cited any sources for the claim that Khan broadcasted """"Jobab Dao"""" in 1971.

Dude, the term """"antisemite"""" has no actual academic value beside shutting down legitimate criticism of Jews? Do me a favor, please don't discuss anything with me regarding your views on theis subject and stick SOLELY to discussion of editing and improving this artcile, because your views are simply too offensive and abhorrent to have to volunarily subject myself to. By the way, I edited the entry to reflect what the College newspaper actually reports, which is that the moves against Macdonald are a result of opposition from school faculty. Despite the fact that bigots like rense like to whine about how evil Jews are persecuting antisemites like Macdonald, I'm afraid the professor has only himself to blame.   
Sorry, but I'm not here to appease your """"getting offended"""" radar. If you feel offended every single time someone is critical of Jews, such as Kevin MacDonald, you have a serious emotional problem, or, you're probably Jewish. MacDonald has himself to blame? Wrong. MacDonald has written three scholarly books on Jews, Judaism, and Jewish political movements. That's his right to do so if he wants to and he should not get into trouble because of it, since, last I checked, the 1st amendment was still valid in America (or so they say). What next?

da664687de73a0c1,"Translation

Being exposed to the two traditions, I am unable to decide which one covers best the definition.How we define freedom itself depends upon various factors - culture, education, environment and individuals own understanding on where the voluntary freedom ends and the legal begins.However, let us see how the French definition reads into English.I admit, this falls beyond my area of specialisation and could possibly be literal in places

Freedom is the sense of acting according to one's own will without being restrained by the power of anyone else.It is defined 

negatively as  the absence from submission,servitude,constraint exercised by someone else.

positively as: the autonomy and spontaniety of a rational being;the voluntary human behaviours are based on freedom and qualified as Free

This notion is seen as an abstract and normative value of the human actions and at the same time like a solid reality.These two perspectives are interwoven in many ways and could lead to errors of categorisation.There are, therefore, numerous confusions that can arise with respect to the term Freedom.So,it is necessary to distinguish the different sense of this word.

The Freedom could be taken as an attribute of the Human Being, of his will and be the condition of natural and positive rights, but also his duties;the effective realisation of the voluntary acts has a dimension that could not be possible without the later.These two ideas of Human existence are not necessarily compatible.For example, the existence of Legal Freedoms can be felt, while its reality (existence in our acts) and its essence (its conception that we have) poses problems.  

The first point could be addressed in a Socio-Political research; the second point constitutes its metaphysical base and particularly the Philosophical understanding of Freedom.This article is divided into two parts to facilitate this understanding.The first part covers the Philosophical aspects - treating the metaphysical notions of Freedom and the second part - the Sociological aspects.However one should keep in mind that the two aspects are interrelated.

Hi!  My name is Ral315, and I'm the editor-in-chief of the Wikipedia Signpost, a weekly newspaper on the English Wikipedia.  I'm sending out an optional questionnaire that I hope you'll respond to.  These questions will be published in next week's issue, and hopefully translated into many languages and copied to the Meta-Wiki prior to the election.  (So, if you speak multiple languages, it'd be fantastic, though certainly not required, if you'd be willing to translate your answers into any languages you speak fluently.)

There's no word limit on any of these questions, but I suggest that brevity (maybe about 300-400 words per answer) is best.  If at all possible, answers should be submitted by 16:00 UTC on Monday, June 25 (though late responses will also be accepted).

I'm posting these to your talk pages because they don't really fit well on question pages (since many will repeat questions you've already answered).  You can reply to me by e-mail, or at my English Wikipedia, English Wikinews or Meta talk pages.

Thanks again for answering these, and good luck in the elections.

Sincerely,
Ral315

When a numbered IP starts screwing with your article, you revert him. End of story. Everyone will back you up on that. Esecially since you're never supposed to delete sourcing from an article. Because people who do that put the article author in the situation you're in now.
I'm just annoyed because Rant Media does quite obviously deserve an article by WP's guidelines. However, because the people who've made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job, writing articles that read like spam, not following Wikipedia's standard format, we've now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt - that's where they """"salt the earth"""" so the article can never again be created.
And meanwhile, once this artilce is deleted, Sean Kennedy'll be spending another 6 months being all whiney and snitty about Wikipedia again. I won't be able to listen to him. 
Ultimately, to reach your goal, it doesn't matter what's right and wrong here. What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that you've followed the rules: that your article is as good as any others and that it's as well-sourced as any others. If you've been watching and listening to Sean Kennedy you already know that. Infiltration requires not being seen to be the enemy. 
Go look at Order of Nine Angles. That's an article I rescued from AfD. The article used to, ages ago, be quite frankly stupid. It's about a supposed Satanic cult, of which there's only 1 confirmed member. But since it was mentioned in half a dozen scholarly books or more, I managed to get the article accepted - by following the rules. It's the only real article I've ever worked on, and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch. If I can make that article acceptable, you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable. The problem is you're almost out of time - you can completely repair an article during AfD, and that will give you a chance to avoid a delete vote. But you'd have to start now.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

2d0e12040d23b5f1,"""== It's not emo. ==

I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that """"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum"""" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.

With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.

First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.

So here we begin...

Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck """"junk in a trunk"""" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.

Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. 
Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)

""""The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.""""

All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this """"scene"""" stuff. 

It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about """"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny""""

Understand what I am pointing out?

Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. 
So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this """"Emo label"""" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Thank you for the useful reference, Domer48.

 a consensus was reached at all (or adjudicated) in the reference you quote above and
 that, if a consensus was displayed, it was as you describe.
I think that the argument supported the original complaint:
""""==NPOV - Murder vs killing ==
There seems to be a bizarre NPOV inconsistency being raised over articles relating to people killed in Ireland. There are (1) victims of IRA / PIRA such as 86 year old Sir Norman Stronge, 8th Baronet and James Stronge; (2) victims of Loyalists such as Pat Finucane (solicitor), (3) “victims” of the British army such as Kieran Fleming; and (4) suicides such as Bobby Sands. There is a vocal and persistent lobby which is pro Irish Republican, many of whom belong to Wikipedia:WikiProject_Irish_Republicanism, which argues (I think) that a death is a killing until somebody is found guilty of murder even when that killing is generally defined and established as murder by law and in the international press.""""...(kiwiexile at DMOZ)  • """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is unresolved, as there is no biding policy in effect. Or do you know any different?  And while editing the section title you could have chosen to fix the spelling, but you didn't.

 Explanation of blocks 
Blocking is a serious matter. The community expects that blocks will be made with good reasons only, based upon reviewable evidence and reasonable judgment, and that all factors that support a block are subject to independent peer review if requested. 

 Notifying the blocked user 
Administrators must supply a clear and specific block reason which indicates why a user was blocked. Block reasons should avoid the use of jargon as much as possible so that blocked users may better understand them. Administrators should also notify users when blocking them by leaving a message on their user talk page unless they have a good reason not to. It is often easier to explain the reason for a block at the time than it is to explain a block well after the fact.

When implementing a block, a number of pro forma block reasons are available in a drop-down menu; other or additional reasons can also be added. Users can be notified of blocks and block reasons using a number of convenient template messages—see Category:User block templates and Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Fixing Assange and resistance: I have preferences set to show cache pages, but """"Assange"""" also took """"18.002 secs"""" (not 0.250) for me to access, obviously bypassing cache but not edited in 3 hours, while other articles showed cache-page copies. That's another performance shock for me: one article bypasses cache. I cleared my entire browser cache, and then Assange showed the cache-page copy. As for broad resistance, the Continuous Improvement movement (Kaizen, etc.) has warned, """"People dislike change"""". Most act like the """"boiling frog"""" and sit while the temperature rises, never moving until too late and """"Beyonce"""" runs 26 seconds (or Assange 18). I advised Jimbo, to add """"More pillars"""" where Performance becomes a major priority, like Civility or NPOV, rather than """"personal preference to see results"""" in the same hour, while they demand the cite-tools still work. You might know I've had severe rejections trying to defuse essay wp:PERF, and explain how the Titanic sank because """"Don't worry"""" thwarted other people from acting or improving (the ship design included ample lifeboats rejected by others). This year, with the Costa Concordia in Italy, passengers worried enough about the tilting ship to call land-based police to complain the ship seemed damaged while crew pretended """"Don't worry"""". Enough. I think we are reaching """"critical mass"""" to move forward here. The next compromise consensus supports all parameters (as demanded pronto), and auto-runs the quick citations, with later promises to """"fix"""" {Citation/core} where possible, and still support those cite-tools which generate {cite_web} calls and such. It is a hideously complex upgrade, with over 23 forks as {cite_book}, {cite_video}, {cite_document}, {cite_press_release}, {cite_encyclopedia}, even """"{citeweb}"""" or """"{cite web}"""" but fixing the most-used will cure the speed problems. Plus, the talk-page already warns to deprecate """"surname1"""" for """"last1"""" where 3 fewer alias parameters could mean 2x faster for that parameter, perhaps next year. Beyond the complex fast {Fcite} templates, the rapid {cite_quick} runs 10x-12x faster, so """"Assange"""" can drop from 18 to 5-second edit-preview. I already saved some temporary revisions to """"prove"""" Assange can reformat in 5 seconds:

 Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors.
 In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as """"You did this wrong"""" or """"He is unwilling"""" or """"He's just always stubborn"""", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words """"you"""" and """"your"""". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, """"I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care """"who started it"""", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion. onka """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hey PS
     Yes, you are right. I have not lived in Kerala in the past 2 years. That doesn't mean I am not familiar with it. Now Amrita TV is not a TV channel watched by the masses. They watch Surya, Asianet or Kairali. If you have been seen on this channel, it means to me in my biased opinion that you are not too famous to have an article in wikipedia. Also remember that there are many singers who have cut their own records. That doesn't mean they have to have an article too.
    Plus I am a frequent listener to malayalam film songs and I have certainly not heard of you. Do not waste your time ranting about whether the article should be deleted or not. Instead focus your energy on singing and becoming famous and then having someone else to have an article written about you. This letter may make you more angry, but I am sorry.

 Completion date 

Once again, someone has changed the completion date to 30 June '09, though this time they have modified the reference so it no longer shows the photo with the billboard saying 30 Dec '08.  The new reference is now to the main page at http://burjdubaiskyscraper.com which does indeed say 30 June '09.  My question is: can burjdubaiskyscraper.com be considered a reliable source?

I think we should change the completion to 2009, but not include an exact date.  Since burjdubaiskyscraper.com is just a third-party site, I do not think they can be trusted with knowing the official information.  But, Emporis.com does have a completion date of 2009; they can be trusted.  Also, I do not know how anyone can know the exact date of the completion of a building.  It would be best to just stick to the year.   (talk | contributions) 

    

 Height in early March 2008 

Several editors have changed the height of the Burj Dubai from 604.9 m to 611.3 m.  I have changed it back to 604.9 metres as no official statment has yet been made by Emaar.  I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.   (talk | contributions) 
I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.    

 Remaining milestones 
I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a """"world's tallest freestanding structure"""" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.    
I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.   (talk | contributions) 

 At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.
  

Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the """"tallest free-standing structure"""", hence the usual addition of """"on land"""" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me 

Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?   
 Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 32.97.110.142

Looks like there's a full-scale edit-war going on again, so I will be staying away. I thought it was stable so I corrected a grammatical nonsense. If a thing never happens again, you can say that the following day it didn't happen, or several months later it didn't happen, or fifty years later it didn't happen, and no one of those statements makes more sense than any other. On the other hand, if a thing does happen, for instance at the end of a year when it is expected to happen, you can still say that after several months it didn't happen, and that might be quite true, although it would still be nonsensical and in this case also misleading. I changed it to """"Buck's contract with Vogue was not renewed"""", period, which in fact gives exactly the same amount of information. If you knew when the contract was due to be removed, you could say that, and that would be a useful addition, but nobody has ever thought to do that.

I didn't write the sentence about the biblical references, I merely supplied them. I don't remember who  wrote the sentence.  However, a federal circuit court, wrote, (one of my deleted references):

The following was excerpted from Iannaccone v. Law, 142 F.3d 553 (2d Cir. 1998):

The right to proceed pro se in civil actions in federal courts is guaranteed by 28 U.S.C. § 1654, which provides: """"In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" Section 1654's guarantee derives directly from the Judiciary Act of 1789.

First introduced in the Senate on June 12, 1789 as part of Senate Bill [S-1], the right to self-representation appeared in section 31 of the Bill. But when the Bill became law, on September 24, 1789, the right was moved to section 35, which reads as follows: """"That in all the Courts of the United States the Parties may plead and manage their own causes personally or by the assistance of such Counsel or Attornies at law as by the rules of the said Courts respectively shall be permitted to manage and conduct causes therein."""" V Documentary History of the First Federal Congress of the United States of America 1789-1791 1150, 1165, 1193 (1986). As can be seen, the right to self-representation has remained constant for over 200 years.

The framers of our Constitution thought self-representation in civil suits was a basic right that belongs to a free people. Although the Supreme Court alluded to civil pro se representation in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 812-13 (1975), the Court there focused its discussion on the right to represent oneself as a defendant in a criminal case, id. at 813 et seq., which the Constitution's Bill of Rights guarantees.

In a criminal prosecution, a pro se party of course may only appear as a defendant. In a civil case, a person may appear pro se as either a plaintiff or defendant. And, as noted, the right of self-representation in one case is protected by the Constitution, and in the other, simply by statute. Further, in contrast to criminal defendants, civil litigants unable to afford counsel cannot ordinarily obtain appointment of counsel, except in circumstances when there is a risk of loss of liberty, as in mental commitment or juvenile delinquency proceedings. See H.B. Kim,Legal Education For the Pro Se Litigant: A Step Towards a Meaningful Right to Be Heard, 96 Yale L. J. 1641, 1646-47 (1987).

Moreover, the historical origins of self-representation in civil and criminal proceedings are different. In Faretta, the Court discussed the historic requirement of having counsel, going back to the infamous English Star Chamber that forced counsel upon an unwilling defendant in a criminal proceeding, and the requirement's gradual reform. This reform was fervently embraced in colonial America for those accused of crime. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 821-26.

Passing from the criminal to the civil context, we . . . observ[e] that a person appearing pro se in federal court can be a mixed blessing because persons appearing pro se lack legal training and may, on occasion, burden the court by filing illogical or incomprehensible pleadings, affidavits and briefs. And sometimes a pro se litigant appears simply for the purpose of using the courtroom to advance a political or social agenda, or to pursue a matter that is legally unredressable. See E.J.R. Nichols, Preserving Pro Se Representation in an Age of Rule 11 Sanctions, 67 Tex. L. Rev. 351, 351 nn.2 & 3 (1988). Yet, even given those potential burdens, there still remains a citizen's right of access to the courts, a strongly held notion stretching back to the beginnings of our Republic. The origins of the right to appear for oneself in civil proceedings derive from a number of sources, all deeply rooted in our history and culture. We undertake to discuss briefly five of those sources, though doubtless there are others:

First, history. Under the English common law with its complicated forms of action and veritable maze of writs and confusing procedures, the right to retain counsel in civil proceedings became a necessity. By the middle of the thirteenth century, lawyers so monopolized the courts in London that the King was forced to decree that, except for a few special causes, litigants were entitled to plead their own cases without lawyers. See The Right to Counsel in Civil Litigation, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 1322, 1325 (1966).

Second, mistrust of lawyers made appearance in court without benefit of counsel the preferred course. See A.L. Downey, Note, Fools and Their Ethics: The Professional Responsibility of Pro Se Attorneys, 34 B.C. L. Rev. 529, 533 (1993). Lawyers had no position of honor or place in society in early colonial days. The pioneers who cleared th",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hey David.  If you have time for an article can you create one about Agnes of Aquitaine, the second wife of Ramiro I of Aragon and the daughter of William VI or VII of Aquitaine?  But you would have to be a little creative about naming her because there is already a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon and Navarre and a Agnes of Aquitaine, Queen of Aragon, and this Agnes' birth and death date are unknown.  
Just doing that.  I'm going to clean up the entire list.  
Just create a stub. Check Isabella of Urgel's article, it's as short as Agnes' article will be and she had a son who was king.  
Thanks David.  You did a fantabulous job. You probably should change the first paragraph to show how her indentity is disputed and how the indentity of her father is disputed between William VI and William VII.  
I don't know. I wish he'll take it less seriously, I mean I can't put any dates that are historically guessed.  He and Srnec are the same.  He seem to only altered Agnes' page but Ermesinda's page seems pretty intact with a few arrangement changes. BTW have you checked any of my new lists, you can check some out at Category:Lists of countesses, Category:Lists of duchesses, Category:Lists of princesses, and Category:Lists of queens.  
I moved it. As for Majorca, it'll be finished after I added the independent queen consorts.  Do you think another page should be created for Agnes of Aquitaine, Countess of Savoy since Agnes, wife of Ramiro I of Aragon isn't really even on both Agnes?  Agricolae removed all the children of the Savoyard Agnes of Aquitaine.  
Yeah I saw that connection of Bertha and Agnes, but we can't be sure if there were one or two Agnes.  We can just say how they may be the same person.  
I don't really care anymore, he must have been easedropping into our conversation.  I hate arguing because in the end I always lose. One bad thing about me is that I'm a pushover.  Well List of Majorcan consorts is done, in time I'll create another section for the titular queen consorts and another section for the Ladies of Balaguer.

12f2dcc06cd0d70f,"SHB pictures 

Here's what I suggest makes a good SHB picture:

Follow the fair use criteria, especially the Images that cannot be fair use guidelines. These supersede all the following criteria. Also, source your images fully (including all applicable from issue/page/panel, scan source, web source) and give a fair use rationale.
Ensure that the picture clearly shows as much of the character as possible:
The ideal image is a full-body, three-quarter picture of the character standing straight with no background, with a facing-the-camera or profile picture as the next-best.
If a full-body shot is unavailable, the picture must show the whole of the head and torso (or the equivalent for non-humanoid characters).
Visibly contorted poses should not be used under any circumstances.
Pictures which hide significant areas the character in shadow should be avoided (exceptions apply only where the shadow is itself part of the character's look - e.g. Raven.), as should pictures where blur or distortion effects are applied.
Colouring should be neutral - pictures which have a heavy colour cast, or otherwise depict the character with false colours should not be uploaded unless the cast has been removed first.
Heavily stylised art should only be considered for use when the character is closely associated with the style to the exclusion of less extreme styles.
Pictures which have more characters and/or objects than the subject of the article should only be used if the subject is the most prominent object - editing the picture, by cropping, obscuring and/or painting out the other characters may help to ensure this.
If the character has a clearly-defined primary costume (e.g. Superman), a picture of this should be used. Otherwise, the most recent ongoing costume of the character should be used.

Hopefully, you can see why I consider the Colossus and Juggernaut pictures (in addition to the earlier Turner pictures) Not Fit For Purpose. -",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Afro-Cuban Sahrawis 

The source cited for the claim that Afro-Cubans are descended from Sahrawi refugees is misrepresented in the article. It does not claim that the Afro-Cuban population is partially comprised of Sahrawis, or that a significant number of Sahrawis immigrated to Cuba. Indeed, the article never even mentions the term """"Afro-Cuban"""". Rather, it details someone's (dubious) claims about Sahrawi children from the Tindouf Camps being abducted to la Isla de Juventud for military training. Assuming that this is not all in his head, this explicitly means they are not Afro-Cuban according to that article; it states that Afro-Cubans are from sub-Saharan Africa. 96.26.213.146  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for uploading Image:Centronics Connector.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

It is a bit hard to carry the burden of proof, when there acoustic vibrations in air, they impress your eardrums but you still say you're not listening. Did I carry the burden of proof? I did. Is the source verifiable? It is. Is the statement appropriate? You agree it is. Does the source validate the statement? It does. Is there any reason to distrust the source? I can't see one but you are welcome to pinpoint any. This said it seems we both have too much time to sit on our heads, and we're going to a pretty pointless discussion, the likes of which, I really abhor. Let's agree on two ground rules. They are sensible, and I think you will accept them. 1) STICK WITH YOUR POINTS. This means that if you think something and state it, you'll recognize you took a hit and acknowledge refutation when refutation is produced. Otherwise, you'll be doing the Apollo Hoax, 2012 stunt, of responding to refutation by going off into a completely different direction, being refuted again resulting in new, fresh and wilder claims. 2) DEFINE A THRESHOLD BY WHICH YOU'LL ACCEPT YOU ARE WRONG. By this point in the discussion the items of disagreement should be clear to you, and refutation of all of them will mean you are wrong. Right?

About other links to the site under dispute. You seem to think you are making sort of a naughty threat about them as in """"One of these days I might have a look at some of them to check whether they qualify,"""" but you fail to notice that if you decree the specific site unreliable here (and I am talking of reliable only) the site is unreliable everywhere in Wikipedia.

Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC): Electronic Plagiarism Detection
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/apppage.cgi?USERPAGE=6588
JISC completed a plagiarism project in 2001, and they are establishing a plagiarism advisory service as a result of this experience. There were 4 parts to their plagiarism project, and they include:
1. Technical review of free-text plagiarism detection software 
2. Technical review of source code plagiarism detection software 
3. A pilot of free-text detection software in 5 UK institutions 
4. A good practice guide to plagiarism detection
A listserv has also been to continue discussions dealing with academic dishonest and plagiarism issues.
A copy of JISC's Technical Review of Plagiarism Detection Software Report can be accessed at http://www.turnitin.com/static/pdf/luton.pdf.
.
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service
http://www.jiscpas.ac.uk/
JISC Plagiarism Advisory Service is a new offering that began in September 2002. It is based in the Information Management Research Institute at Northumbria University (UK). New materials are constantly being added to this plagiarism portal, but it currently offers advice & guidance, educational materials for students and other online resources. A plagiarism detection service, supported by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) until August 2004, is based on the turnitin.com platform and allows instructors to conduct electronic comparisons of work complete by students.
JPlag
https://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/jplag/
Guido Malpohl initially developed this software which is designed to detect academic dishonesty. The software does more than merely compare the text of documents. JPlag also looks at program language syntax and program structure so it can also be used to detect stolen software parts. Instructors may use JPlag for free, but they must first set up an account in order to prevent unauthorized use by students.
Library Electronic Databases
http://www.library.uiuc.edu/orr/
The Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign provides access to numerous electronic resources for students and faculty. Instructors may want to consult these resources when checking for plagiarism. Full text databases like EBSCO and Expanded Academic ASAP (InfoTrac) are two obvious starting points when checking undergraduate assignments. One thing to keep in mind is that some resources that are not full text but provide abstract information are often used by students.
Moss
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html
Moss or Measure of Software Similarity is a tool that has been used primarily to detect plagiarism. The way it works is that it detects similarities of C, C++, Java, Pascal, Ada, ML, Lisp or Scheme programs. Moss is free to use for instructors and staff of programming language courses only.
Plagiarism.org
http://www.plagiarism.org 
University of California Berkeley students and alumni created plagiarism.org to be used to detect plagiarism. One thing to watch out for is that the software doesn't differentiate between quoted materials and original writing. 
The Plagiarism Resource Site
http://www.plagiarism.phys.virginia.edu/
Lou Bloomfield, Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia, is the sole author of The Plagiarism Resource Site. The goal of this site is to """"help reduce the impact of plagiarism on education and educational institutions"""". Numerous links are provided to sources on how to deal with plagiarism.
Turnitin
http://www.turnitin.com/
Turnitin, a plagiarism.org partner, considers themselves to be """"the world's most widely recognized and trusted resource for helping prevent Internet plagiarism"""". Free trials are also available, and subscription costs vary depending on the type of plan chosen.
Turnitin is currently the subject of a copyright controversy. For more information, check out the following article, """"A Plagiarism Detection Tool Creates Legal Quandary"""" at http://chronicle.com/free/v48/i36/36a03701.htm.

You realize, No September, that you're essentially giving in to trollery here?  John Kerry and George W Bush attract trolls, predictably.  Well, the solution they've come up with is pretty good; semi-protect, and put a trollery warning on the talk page.  Why was so much more censoring action done here, while allowing MONGO to edit without accountability and locking up the talk page and refusing to hear of the matter on his talk page, effectively giving him total control of the article?  This is not a """"value judgement"""" case; policy provides for a specific case just like this!

Do not edit or revert a temporarily protected page, except to add a protected page notice, a link to Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute or Wikipedia:NPOV dispute, or a similar disclaimer about the current state of an article, unless there is widespread agreement that the page was protected in violation of these policies.
Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over.
Admins should not protect pages in which they are involved. Involvement includes making substantive edits to the page (fixing vandalism does not count), or expressing opinions about the article on the talk page before the protection. Admin powers are not editor privileges — admins should only act as servants to the user community at large. If you are an admin and you want a page in an edit war in which you are somehow involved to be protected, you should contact another admin and ask them to protect the page for you. Not only is this the preferable method, it is also considered more ethical to do so as it helps reduce any perceived conflict of interest.
 Important Note: When a page is particularly high profile, either because it is linked off the main page, or because it has recently received a prominent link from offsite, it will often become a target for vandalism. It is not appropriate to protect pages in this case. Instead, consider adding them to your watchlist, and reverting vandalism yourself.
Why weren't these policies complied with?  This is not a special case; the policy provides for cases just like this.  WHy are you ignoring this, and why is this being ignored at the requests for unprotection?  Moreover, If MONGO is so innocent, why is he refusing to discuss it, unless he is mocking editors who raise concerns?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Can we agree to keep the tag based on the principle that it is better present when not needed (false-positive) than not when needed (false-negative)? I am not too concerned with the current """"notable..."""" phrase but second Leifern's tagging, for example because of a concern I brought up about a week ago that the ocntrovertial nature of homeopathy should not be alluded to twice in the introduction becase it diverts the issue from exegesis to premature evaluation; I suggested a comprehensive sentence that highlighted rather than obscured the controvertiallity issue but without this diversion. There are many little things in the article that were written from a lay perspective of those who have read a bit about homeopathy and think that they know a lot, and unless those are repaired there is no reason to remove the tag. Besides, it is reasonable to have this tag on indefinitely due to the wide disagreement on the topic. This is not a bad thing as one thing can be stated with certainty: that the issue of homeopathy is not as simple as it looks, so each reader will need both critical faculties and research time to make sense of it. 1 July 2005 14:28 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Oh Mark, for shame! Why lie? I didn't get banned from the Clitoris article for any such thing. I didn't get banned from it at all. I was banned from removing the picture that upset several editors. You pretended you had a """"unanimous"""" """"consensus"""" then too. I didn't constantly run any polls. That's a downright lie too. Why would I? I don't think polls demonstrate consensus and I oppose their use to settle content disputes. I've expressed that view many, many times. The dispute on clitoris in fact centred around a group of editors who were bullying minority-view editors because they had won a vote. They largely refused to discuss the salient issues because, they believed, they had won a vote and that was that. (Careful Tony Sidaway watchers will note that on Talk:Clitoris he was insistent that winning a vote was the same as having a consensus but on Talk:something about B roads, he had changed his tune and thought that votes were evil. Like most of the people who voted here, it's one rule when it fits your POV, another when it doesn't.) This title is shockingly POV. That you can line up a bunch of editors who share the POV that it pushes to vote and say no it's not doesn't actually not make it so, but I've given up trying to get editors to accept that the proZionist stance that is so common in your home country is not actually """"neutral"""". I advise the other editors here that their commitment to NPOV will not be rewarded, because it simply is not shared by everyone here.

 Template:Infobox WRC driver/sandbox 

dHi Pelmeen. I saw your message at WT:RALLY regarding an updated version of the WRC driver infobox template. I've taken a look and I have some suggestions:
 Instead of calling it """"Infobox WRC driver"""", we should call it """"Infobox Rally driver"""". Although not often, we are beginning to cover drivers from IRC, ERC and other notable rally drivers who aren't WRC drivers.
 There shouldn't be a reason for both of the name= and fullname= fields, one should suffice (This is a fault with the current template, also)
 Instead of calling the next section of the infobox """"World Rally Championship record"""", there should be an additional field that the editor can choose options of WRC, IRC, ERC, etc etc so that we can use this infobox on other rally drivers
 The co-driver= field should be made clear in the """"doc"""" page that this shouldn't be used just for the current co-driver, especially if the drivers' previous co-drivers are notable and have Wikipedia articles
 Same for teams=
 The races= field, which is generated in the Rallies line of the infobox  it's unclear what this is for perhaps change it to races-number= or even better, add an additional field rallies-number=, tell users in the doc that """"races"""" is depreciated and """"rallies"""" is preferred (because the output is """"Rallies"""")
 I'm not sure that the points= field is necessary. What importance is is that Sebastien Loeb, for example, has won 1133 in his career? We only care about the current season. There is no championship for total points, and because the length of each drivers' career is different, it's not really comparable between different drivers
 I'm interested in seeing the medaltemplates= field in use. What is this for?
Hope these comments help, I'll watch the sandbox with interest for additional updates.    Chat   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

(In comparison to the lovely areas of the Spanish coast to the west of Gibraltar.) If there really are concerns about the Gibraltar government's off-hand comments about not wanting """"nasty"""" material added - which seemed quite innocent and unremarkable to me - then the concerned people should spend some time adding neutral and due weight content from guide books to some of the Gibraltar-related article. I somehow doubt there will be mass reverting of such additions, which will helpfully show that we're still getting neutral and encyclopedic content.

If all of this brings us to a point where detailed summaries of such respected guide books can be easily accessed through Wikipedia when visiting Andalucia, that would be a huge benefit to people like me. So get to it!

Unfortunately, judging from previous """"warnings,"""" some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. Pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a Request for Admin proceding, as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. Pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack (and it has, in fact, been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once). 

Frankly, if you are looking for personal attacks, try yourself for your AGF-violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals, or David Gerard for claiming that I am """"trolling"""" when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. It's very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.

 Werner's Transformation 

Thanks for the feedback.

The section titled The era of the est training (1971 - 1984) says: He [Werner] started to see the world as perfect """"the way it is"""" and reported an insight that his attempts to change or modify either his physical circumstances or his mental outlook had their basis in a conception of the world (that it should differ from """"the way it is"""") that precluded or at least limited one's experiential and creative appreciation of it.

This attempts to describe a pivotal evet in Werner's life that he referrs to as a transformation. I felt that the description above fell way short of what it was that Werner has said he experienced. I'm not sure what the source of this material is. Describing an experience like this is exceedingly difficult. Seeing the world as perfect actually, I believe, was only a part of Werner's experience of transformation. Here is how Werner described it in his own words in the film Transformation: The Life and Legacy of Werner Erhard.

The way est happened was very simple. I had this transformational experience. I had a transformation. Whoever I had been up until that point I no longer was. I was on my way to work and there was nothing significant about it but I was on the Golden Gate Bridge. I just happened to be there and that's when I had the realization that what my life was about was really meaningless. It was empty. And this realization that the things that I thought were so significant like looking good and winning, just the normal things that most people think are important, that they really had no importance, that it was all empty and meaningless. When I broke through the sadness, broke through the sense of despair of having wasted my life, I all of a sudden realized """"My God, I'm free."""" What's that mean to be free: free to choose, free to create a life that was worth living.

In order to describe it accurately why not quote Werner directly? I did my best to capture his words exactly as he spoke them. Is that considered a reliable source, given that it's a record of him speaking personally?

My purpose in posting this was to improve this section first for accuracy and second to elaborate in an event that was pivotal in his life.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have considered your disrespectful comments towards my Scholarly Review article and, now that the Christmas holidays are over, I am obliged to let my anger with your remarks be known. I shall start with you, NatureBoyMD. NatureBoyMD, you reffered to my article as dubious. This is ironic, considering that you as a person are quite dubious. When I read your opinions of my article, I scoff at you. Your argument is so ill founded that I cannot even take you seriously. It is quite obvious to me, and all the memembers of the SGAS, that your dissatisfaction with the page citations is not an indication of the article's """"dubiousness"""", but rather an indication of your ignorance of Goosebumps and literature in general. If you think people need a citation as to where the camera in Say Cheese and Die came from,, then you need to understand what is common knowledge and not. For instance, If i were to write that the sky is blue, of that the earth is round, or that MACman202 has no idea what he is talking about, most reasonably intelligent humans would agree with such widely known facts. Such is the same for Goosebumps and R.L. Stine. When I say that the plots """"are masterfully formulated"""" or imply that R.L. Stine is brilliant, the majority of people recognize that the two statements are widely known facts. 
As for you MACman202, any notion what so ever that you have the ability to recognize fine literature """"has to be one of the most laughable things I have ever heard"""" (NatureBoy, I included quotations in the last quote so that you, always one to want a citation for the obvious, will know that I quote this MACman202 himself). MacMan, it is quite bold of you to assume that there is so scholar behind my article. Perhaps you should stick to editing the Simon and Garfunkel page on wikipedia. I am sure you are quite familiar with it already.
Tony Fox, you and NatureBoyMD seem to be on the  same page as far as your inability to recognize common knowledge is concerned. To me it seems that you label anything you do not agree with as a """"peacock term."""" I find this most repulsive, as I, like most free thinking, intelligent people believe that speech should not be censored because someone does not agree with it. You can take comfort in the fact that you are not the only one guilty of this unjust censorhip. MACman202 and NatureBoy are just as guilty. Each of you should devote, as I have, your mind to understanding the beauty and brilliance of Goosebumps. When you feel that you have researched Goosebumps as much as I have (it is very unlikely that you ever will) then you may suggest alterations to my scholarly review. Until then, your comments are not welcome, and they certainly will not be tolerated any longer.

a43ff425ff215a86,"""A few ideas to balance the US centric style.

Whilst you have brought in large area of British (mainly English and Welsh) facts neverthe less the opening paragraphs are somewhat US based.  I have no knowledge whatsoever on anything other than the UK perspective (though as this contributes significantly to US law, it will at least set some history.  

I am also a little bit concerned at why juries were created in the first place, you state that this is because they are believed to be free from bribery. Historically, trial by jury arose because of the difficulties of securing trial by ordeal, due to a change in church law.  By that time juries already sat to decide if there was a primae facie case to answer (the modern equivalent being Grand Juries).

The history of trial by jury (in England and hence the US) is related to several important events, most notebly the Assizes of Clarendon, the Fourth Lantern Council and the Magna Carta.

It may be useful for you to have a look at some of the wikipedia sites listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_ordeal

""""In the Assize of Clarendon, enacted in 1166 and the first great legislative act in the reign of the English Angevin King Henry II, the law of the land required that: """"anyone, who shall be found, on the oath of the aforesaid [a jury], to be accused or notoriously suspect of having been a robber or murderer or thief, or a receiver of them ... be taken and put to the ordeal of water.""""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Lateran_Council

Canons 14-18. Rules on the conduct of the clergy including against such things as: non-celibate living, drunkenness, frequenting taverns, hunting, conducting trials by ordeal or combat 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta

Though you may be best considering the uk statute site which says:
http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519

""""NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor [X5 condemn him,] but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.""""

WP:OVERLINKING policy on Wikipedia:Generally, a link should appear only once in an article, but if helpful for readers, links may be repeated in infoboxes, tables, image captions, footnotes, and at the first occurrence after the lead. If an article of 1,000 lines has a link repeated on line 600 there is no objection to keep te second link. A link repeated three times in the same paragraph is just plain overkill. Any undesirable future edits (removal of templates) should be adressed by closely monitoring your watchlist, not placing an excessive amount of duplicate links.
 ...is to keep everything in a format that is uniform with everything... In my opinion, that's just impossible. Imperial versus metric, inch versus foot and inch, alphabetic versus historical order, etc. Using other units for Railgauge templates than its corresponding categories and article titles makes it harder to recognise a particular Railgauge when editing or reading text, especially for people accustomed to metric systems. When the list of track gauges, navbox track gauges, article titles and categories all mention 3ft 6in it is odd to use the devious 42in RailGauge template. Moreover, the Railgauge templates are only for conversion purposes and not intended for sorting lists by size or alphabet. Uniformity for the sake of uniformity serves no purpose.
Taking WP:NPOV, in particular WP:BALASPS in consideration, Rail transport in Disney Parks is not less or more significant than a randomly chosen rapid transit rail system, famous heritage railway, abandoned railway or extensively used common carrier railway. There are numerous other railways transporting huge numbers of passengers, preserving steam locomotives or having other notable features.

Hi Howard and all the rest of you guys Americans or d'ailleurs,

I favor Howard's proposal of having an article to list all of the third-party participants in the Iran-Iraq War, not just a separate article for U.S.

I was kidding when I said that adding U.S. to both sides would fix the infobox, but not kidding in the sense that if someone sticks U.S. in one side, the history shows U.S. should be in both sides.

I am inclusionist with respect to the infobox and think that anybody who moved arms to either side should be included.  

All of this is hashed out ad naseum above but the new Iranian guy has kicked it all off again by throwing U.S. into the info box once again bringing us back into the grand and glorious infobox debate territory.

Also there are two other guys (C-Suit and B-Louie) going into endless debates about a single Iranian war slogan (something like """"Onward, beans and bagels, fight fight fight for Palestine"""" or something like that) that one insists is real and the other insists is invented but I can't for the life of me figure out why either of them considers it worthy of so much debate.  Oh yes, the slogan is """"We will keep fighting until we win"""".  You'd hope so, don't you think?  What else would they say, """"We will keep fighting until we stop fighting or whatever""""?  That would not be a very effective slogan!

Is there some way we can combine the slogan debate and the infobox debate into one huge bonfire of nitpicking?

I'd like that!

Wouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? """"Emo"""" is basically this generation's """"grunge"""". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because """"emo"""" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. """"Grunge"""" bands hated being called grunge too. 

And there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.

Agreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. 

A lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |

Try as I might, I'm not really able to associate your Zebra analogy with this article. For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the """"comparison"""" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself. The fact it mentions Blu-ray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the Talk: pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing Blu-ray and HD DVD studio support. 

To be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.

Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet. How the magnet is connected will affact the experiment, so it needs to be displayed how that is. It is possible the are from two different magnets, in which case there are also magnetic fields around the experiment.  Seccond in the regionN S, there is a tension, like a compressed spring. When the radiation leaves the mass, it is effected by the tension. This experiment proves electrons dont have a negative charge. They dont exist. Radiation, has a direct effect on magnetism, and this experiment, needs to be redone, and explored.",0,0,0,0,0,0

That's still wrong. Nobody knows who Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta is other than her mother, and Lady Gaga is the name her famous so that is appropriate, as is Madonna's since virtually no one would know her by her real name. However, in the case of real people and not stagenames, it seems inappropriate, certainly illiterate and uneducated to title an article by his nickname, especially when he is not generally known by that name. It is the same thing for New York U.S. Senator, """"Chuck Schumer"""" which is purely his advertising name, promoted by his marketing staff, since his name that he was known entirely by for most of his political career, and until very recently, was """"Charles"""". However, to humanize him, as """"Jim"""" Inhofe's staff has done with him for marketing purposes, rather than James for which the other 49 states and the international population know him as, is both misleading and essentially promoting informalism as an accepted format for an encyclopaedia. And informalism ought to be attributed to poor scholarship and simple, less educated work - not an excuse for poor workmanship...   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Once again, Bear teaches people how to get themselves killed.  As Wikipedia's own article on dehydration and the article on human urine notes, drinking urine, like drinking saltwater, does nothing at best, and increases the rate of dehydration at worst.  Normal urine contains about 95% water and 5% dissolved solids, much of which is salts.  The more dehydrated you are, the higher the percentage of salt in the urine.  Your body is only about 1% salt.  Water follows a diffusion gradient, so water *leaves* your cells to dilute the urine.  The kidneys can pump ions out of your blood to try and lower the salt concentration, but not *that* effectively.  Just like drinking seawater to survive is stupid and nearly universally recommended against, you shouldn't survive on urine, either.  And here, we're just talking about the salt, let alone the ammonia, nitrates, aldehydes, and other toxins that your body is trying to get rid of.  And all of this assumes that it doesn't make you vomit outright and lose even more water.

Can you please try to see the glass being half full instead of half empty.  I'm certainly not trying to do anything that you or others would see as """"problematic"""".  Five weeks ago I was getting involved in wikipedia and I was feeling enthusiastic, so I posted something to some user groups (reaching 10,000+ members), encouraging them to contribute to wikipedia.  I thought, at the time, that long-time wikipedia people would be more welcoming of new people, and that wikipedians would be happy that I encouraged others to participate.  I was not trying to target and encourage employees of a commercial product to contribute.  The groups I posted to were user groups, not employee groups.  But yes, I guess that some employees belong to these groups as well.  And my comment about Hill using the talk page was simply to comment that my personal POV is that he found a good way for someone with COI to contribute. 

I feel that the negative and accusing tone of your last sentence is unwarranted. It is un-welcoming comments like that that drive away new wikipedia contributors.  I see my wikipedia contributions as a way of giving unselfishly to the world, trying to spread knowledge and improve understanding.  I think that even if I only have time to make a small number of contributions, I feel I am helping, and that this should be the spirit of wikipedia.  So seeing your criticism that I am not making enough edits to non-commercial products is just frustrating and disheartening to me.
I hate feeling that I have to defend my reputation here, and I don't agree with you that editing non-commercial pages should improve anyone's appearance of trustworthiness.  However, your claim that I am only editing the wikipedia entries of """"these commercial products"""" is also just incorrect.  I don't know if there is a way to view the wikipedia contributions of others, but if there is, you would see that I've been making edits to many non-commercial pages, including CRISP-DM, Data mining, the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, Predictive analytics, Statistics, Customer retention, Predictive Model Markup Language, Anomaly detection, SEMMA, Machine learning, Jacques Cousteau, SIGKDD, Decision tree learning.  Sometimes I'm making simple formatting edits, and sometimes I'm spending hours trying to track down the right references to put on the CRISP-DM page.  Yes, my edits are mostly in the general area of data mining, because that is where I have the greatest interest and knowledge.  Similarly, when I guest lecture at local universities, I lecture to these types of classes, not due to any collusion, but because that's what I know.

Thanks for listening to my mini-rant.  I know I'm taking this more personally than you probably meant it.  But it bothers me when someone questions that I am not working hard enough or they question my ethics, and that's what your comments feel like.  All I'm asking is that long-established wikipedia people be more welcoming and encouraging, and give new people the benefit of the doubt that they are acting in good faith trying to make meaningful contributions (however small).  New people grow and adjust - but it takes a while to learn the conventions of the wikipedia community.  Please be patient and encouraging to new people.

Okay, thanks, that's clear, I will action that when I get time. It is not really that I am attacking anybody, but that I am defending myself again the attacks of User:Bobrayner against articles that I spent a lot of time on (without pay) to inform readers. The main objection I have to User:Bobrayner's editing is that he edits articles without any proper knowledge of the subject and then substitutes his own interpretation, the result being a bunch of errors. Let me give a recent example to illustrate. In the article on the Marxian concept of Surplus product, User:Bobrayner recently wiped out the sentence """"The concept plays an important role in Das Kapital"""", but for no good reason. After all, Marx writes that: """"Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the size of a given quantity of wealth must be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product."""" Cap. Vol. 1, Penguin, pp. 338-339. This is absolutely central to Marx's argument. The concept is discussed in more detail across about ten pages and at least five places in Capital Vol. 2, and again in at least 11 different places in Capital Vol. 3. So it is an important theoretical concept in Das Kapital. Yet User:Bobrayner wipes that out! Next, I write """"Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics, surplus economics as well as sociology and other social sciences”. User:Bobrayner wipes out “surplus economics”, “archaeology”, “sociology” and “other social sciences” so that the  sentence now reads: “Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics.[2] political anthropology, cultural anthropology, economic anthropology” (in that case, it should really be “AND economic anthropology”). However, scholars familiar with the concept know quite well that this concept is used exactly in the way that I said, and references can be provided for this (in fact I quote plenty examples in the rest of the article). However, if I provided references, then User:Bobrayner will no doubt wipe them out on the ground that I am offering a “quote farm” or some such thing. User:Bobrayner next wipes out the statement that “For most of the history of civil society, the meaning of the surplus product was fairly obvious and clear. It consisted of (1) that part of what workers produced (products, offspring or services) which they had to hand over to the chief, the landowner, the lord, or the state, as a tax, rent or tribute, and (2) incidental surplus produce, in excess of the producers' own requirements, which was traded for other goods. However, the meaning of surplus product becomes less clear in capitalist society (see below).” There is nothing particularly controversial about this statement, and it could be referenced without any problem; I explain the reasoning in subsequent sections of the article. Next, User:Bobrayner wipes out “the statement that “Since trade always involves two or more parties with their own interests in the matter, the meanings of that trade can be construed in different ways by different stakeholders, and they can evolve across time. If that is the case, the economic meanings of trade are never completely fixed once and for all. Such ambiguities gave rise to many different interpretations of what """"fair trade"""" or """"just trade""""(and therefore trade of benefit to society) might be considered to be. For a long time, it was very difficult for economic theorists to separate out the moral judgement about different kinds of trade, from a scientific appraisal of the actual objective processes of trade, because commerce was dominated by legal codes and by religion.” For any scholar of the subject, this is quite obvious, but nevertheless User:Bobrayner wipes it out. After wiping out a few more small  clarifying bits, User:Bobrayner modifies the sentence “The existence of a surplus product normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour” and adds, “In Marxism, the existence of a """"surplus product"""" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour.” But this doesn’t even distinguish between Marx and all sorts of Marxisms or Marxists or other historians using this concept.  When I write carefully, “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers typically have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any public criticism of the state  that the critic  could be fined, imprisoned or killed,” then User:Bobrayner changes that to “With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has",0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all let me say that you were way more polite about that than I expected. 

Before I created the stubs I checked through the Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting pages, to ensure that they followed the guidlines laid out there, but I found my self very disturbed by the amount of control the project is attempting to exert. I have nothing against the members and I am sure that the aims and goals of the project and the people involved with it are only trying to help Wikipedia. However, I find the idea of having to ask permission to edit is un-Wikipedia like. We trust editors to create articles, complex templates, categories and upload material, but to create a stub type, they have to ask permission. Do you not find it a bit strange that you need to ask permission (Wikipedia:Stub types for deletion/Log/2008/April/6) to delete a category, update nine templates and create the correct category?

No, he disagreed with me on a substantive issue.  Another administrator blocked me punitively on a substantive issue (because that administrator supported the sources added to the article while I didn't) to prevent me from protesting the second rate, non-verifiable sources in an article.

Knowledgebattle certainly know that User talk:ReliableBen just made a manipulative statement, when you said, """"ZChN does not exist."""" By simply saying, """"does not exist"""", it leaves out the fact that it did, and that the political ideology still lingers. Racism didn't die in the US after the slaves were freed; the ZChN ideology doesn't die just because the party has all but disbanded. The party that many of them went on to, Polska Jest Najważniejsza, is in fact nationalist, as the name, itself, makes clear. And from there, Polska Razem. Being Rightist conservatives, it's no wonder he just made the same kind of comment that one would expect from Donald Trump: """"Everyone must realise how big a mistake it was to attempt to relocate groups of Muslim immigrants in Poland."""" When Christians bomb something or attack someone, no Christians assert that anyone should kick the Christians out of the country, or that it's a mistake to let Christians live in their country. The man is anti-Semetic (in regard toward both Jews and Muslims). He's making that very clear.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes I am not sure best how to proceed here. One of the problems with consistency is that generally the most commonly reported numbers are the general opinion as I understand the matter. Two of the ways we could proceed are either 

I. Add a column noting that these are the """"most likely voting numbers"""" or however you want to label it and the other as """"general opinion"""". This can result in updating the current chart where you may have to list one or more numbers for each poll which is kind of problematic.

Hi HaiB, I just wanted to thank you for your concern, and express my appreciation for your proactive approach in recent matters.  At this time I am not actively seeking any escalation to what I consider to be a difficult editor.   If blowing off a little steam on my talk page is what it takes to reduce overall drama on the site, and get back to building and protecting this project - I am more than willing to shoulder these types of things.  While administrators are editors equal in stature to those who are not wielding the couple extra buttons, we are expected to conduct ourselves with a higher degree of integrity, and often come under fire for the actions that we must undertake.  I realized that when I accepted my RFA nom., and am willing to suffer the occasional insults and attacks that our less congenial editors wish to throw.  Thank you again for your concern, your kindness, and your integrity; it is much appreciated. ;) —    ?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

No, not purely on state boundaries. It's remarkable that the straight line on the map does the job so well. Of course, that's an approximation too. The exception to state boundaries is in southern NSW, mostly the Riverina, which is Aussie Rules country. One can see it by looking at the shapes of footy grounds and goalposts when travelling through that area. (Even on Google Maps, if you want to do your own research.) This is probably due to the fact that it is actually closer to Melbourne than Sydney, and the early rail lines connected to Melbourne rather than Sydney back in the nineteenth century.

I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.  That's why I added the tag, because what I read gave me cause to believe that this article was slanted in one direction.

Would it be possible to suggest that religion (according to Cicero, from Latin  re- """"again"""" + legere """"read"""") is a human survival strategy which allows those within to co-operate in securing their future - sometimes at the expense of their neighbors' survival. 

Hence th prohibition about killing and the 'just war' philosophy. It is significant that the scriptural (i.e. written) Judaic origin of the world and the garden of Eden is closely linked to the time and place (Ur was around Basra in modern Iraq) where writing was invented. The peripatetic Jewish nation  invaded Palestine (land of the Philistines) after, and their holy writings record much of this.

 The casual reader should receive the message that the expulsions were agreed to at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.  They should also be aware that Stalin outmaneuvered the gullible Western Allies at both those conferences.  Stalin didn't care about the Poles (he killed 22,000 Poles, mostly Polish military officers, at Katyn in 1940); Stalin was more concerned about gaining back lands lost in the early 1920s, namely lands within the 1937 Polish border east of the Curzon Line.  That land area had a population which included 40% ethnic Poles.  Stalin needed somewhere to dump those Poles, so he proposed that Germans be moved west & the Poles be moved west.  Roosevelt was dying in 1945 - he was easily outmaneuvered by Stalin.  By the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 Churchill had lost power and had to leave the conference early, and Truman was tied down by Roosevelt's commitments, so Stalin got his way again.   The casual reader should also receive the message that the """"Wild"""" expulsions by both Russian and Polish authorities were begun east of the Oder-Neisse Line and long before the end of July 1945 Potsdam Conference which ONLY authorized the ethnic cleansing of Germans from within the 1937 borders of Poland, and from Czechoslovakia and Hungary.  The Potsdam Agreement separated all German territory east of the Oder-Neisse Line from """"Occupation Germany"""" (all of that German territory east of the Oder-Neisse Line had been part of the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany prior to the Potsdam Conference).  Most of that German territory was placed under temporary Polish Administration pending the final Peace Treaty for World War 2.  The Potsdam Agreement also stipulated that Northern East Prussia to be  placed under temporary Soviet Administration pending the final Peace Treaty for World War 2.  Note: there is a distinction between """"Occupation"""" and """"temporary Adminsitration"""" as delineated by the Potsdam Agreement.

I suppose it’s just possible that it does, and will show up as a new episode at some time, but the makers don’t usually provide any early announcement of new episodes: you just have to watch out for them in the guides to forthcoming programs!

Also, following what seems to be usual practice, I’ve assumed that the first episode on the DVD will be titled “Santa’s Grotto”, though we don’t know yet when it will be first be shown on TV. We can fill the rest in when we know exactly what episodes are to be included, and their order. Presumably any new episodes being included on the DVD will be first broadcast prior to the DVD release date?       

“Digiguide” is indicating that there are two new episodes (“Freddy Fox” and “Whistling”) showing on Five on the 24th September at 8.15 a.m. and 8.25 a.m., presumably to be followed on later (weekdays?) by further new episodes.

If your answer is """"Well, because some journalist said so"""", then you need to back down. I've been involved in the goth scene (but am not at the moment) and the MOST irritating thing to goths is when the metal crowd try to budge in and try to normalise the misconception that any form of metal would have anything to do with the gothic rock genre. There was a concensus made previously, but Blackmetalbaz chose to ignore it and decided to go dictator on the article. WHY is someone who SO OBIOUSLY has an agenda of normalising the misconceptions get control over an article, when MANY MANY people INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL FUCKING SCENE don't get to edit SHIT?!

 Actually a Subculture? 

I've seen at least a couple arguments over whether or not """"emo"""" is a discernible modern genre or subculture, of if it's merely a pejorative term, a sort of made-up scapegoat genre and subculture. Of course none of this come from credible sources. Do we have any? Has anyone else heard anything similar? 128.186.230.124  

I don't completely understand what you just said or asked, but yes we have sources that call it a subculture. Just not the """"right"""" sources appairintly (sorry I spelled that wrong).   

Emo is a genre of music. Some sources lacking authority and/or reliability call it a """"subculture"""" - but many of them also make some interesting claims (e.g. """"Emos worship death"""" - certainly, such religious beliefs may help set them apart as a subculture, but this is of course totally untrue and nonsense).   

I've only seen one source that has said they worship death, and that source was complete crap anyway. Second, some of the sources are certainly reliable they just lack authority which is what we need but also what we don't have so nothing can be done(boo bad sources). Oh, and Emo is a Subgenre of music (LOL, yeah, I know, I'm being needlesly picky about what Emo is and what Emo is not but still it is a Subgenre of music). IMO, Emo is a Subculture but my oppinion is completely worthless as far as wikipedia is concerned. I'm not a good source, none of us are (LOL).   

If they are known to misuse the word then that would make them unreliable. """"Emos worship death"""" is just one of a number of contentious claims that leads unlearned sources to the false idea that it is any more than a genre of music. neonwhite   talk 

Course it would, but I would like to know how all of them misuse """"Subculture."""" Yes I do reliase your alluding to the MSN source (at least that's how I see it) but I'd still like to know. Also, any source that says we worship death would probably be BS, no? So far that is the only contentious statement that I'm seeing. BTW, it is more than a form of music, we just don't have the sources that say it, so those of us who want it to be more on wikipedia can't do anything, oh well.   

There is no evidence that it represents anything other than a genre of music that is why 'subculture' is misused. We can't have an article about a subculture that no-one has defined regardless of whether a media sources uses the term. It would be a one sentence article. neonwhite   talk

4795dcbbc6b85912,"""First of all, the Gibson report is not a government report. Not that it matters, because stating that government reports are by nature reliable is ridiculous. Now, the reliability of any source can be questioned, which results in a discussion. This discussion is settled with arguments. It is not required that such arguments are themselves held to the same standard as the article text, so arguments being, for instance, original research, can be perfectly alright, as long as they are not cited in the article. On a talk page, we are not editors. MastCell is fundamentally wrong.  

I'm sorry but I think both mast cell and the unregistered user misunderstand the issue here. JFW has expressed an intention to publish unsubtantiated, inflammatory claims which will be to the detriment of a patient community, from an unreliable source. Suzy Chapman and I have been trying to illustrate how unreliable the source is and how unsubstantiated the claims are. We have been providing copious evidence and plausible arguments as to why, but frankly it feels we are running around in circles. We are certainly not engaging in 'spurious arguments'. IF this goes ahead, the reputation of Wikipedia, Simon Wessely himself and possibly the Gibson may be severely damaged, because public calls for full verification will have to be made by the patient community, and Wikipedia's displayed determination to publish unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims from unreliable sources (NOT a government document). Suzy has attempted to resolve this problem by verifying the situation by Gibson himself via letter. But neither of us have suggested to phone up the subject on the phone: Sciencewatcher has. So already we have misreading of the facts being exhibited here.

But in addition there is a marked inconsistency here: all sorts of debate goes on at Wikipedia. Calling the discussion """"the din of argumentation, speculation, unverfiable personal commentary"""" DOES NOT MAKE IT SO just because you say. And just because you can't be bothered to study the points does not make the points irrelevant! I have developed quite a lot of familiarity with Wikipedia processes, and both Mast Cell and the unregistered user don't seem to be following them. I suggest that certain people stop pulling Wiki-rank 'I know more about Wiki than you' and act responsibly in this, for Wikipedia and the subject concerned, if not for a patient community.

PS- The below is simply wrong and I would like an apology!!!! and would like the seeking alpha references put back in place -  thank you

The source used by the article was a press release from Pasternak‎'s lawyers. If we have the comment carried by reliable sources third party sources, then perhaps. But WP:BLP: """"Unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material about living persons—whether the material is negative, positive, or just questionable—should be removed immediately """" (emph added).  The Red Pen of Doom 
I was agreeing with your removal, so you don't have to justify it to me, but you're still wrong about who the source was from. It wasn't from his lawyers. It was from seeking alpha, and you summarized the edit as """"After Knight Trading: a press release from Pasternak's lawyers is not valid source for WP:PEACOCK language"""". I think you just didn't notice the reference with the seeking alpha site before the reference with the law firm site. 
Also, it is not an explicit policy to remove all sources that come from a client's law firm, particularly when they state facts about the disposition of a case. WP:RS does not indicate party-affiliated sources cannot be moved. In fact, it provides explicit guidelines for when its inclusion is appropriate (WP:SELFPUB). Also, the WP:BLP policy has two parts for removal of facts from a BLP: 1) the fact has to be unsourced or poorly sourced, and 2) the source must not be """"written by the subject of the BLP"""". In this case, it was written by [presumably] his lawyers. Either his lawyers stand in his shoes, and so it fails #1 (because it's poorly sourced by virtue of not being sufficiently second-party, a contention which isn't cut and dried) but meets #2 (because it's written by his represenatatives), or it doesn't fail #1 but does fail #2 (a strange place to be).

Responses:
1 - I was not referring to this, only your posts on Wikipediocracy recently.
2 - I was not referring to these events dating back to 2009, it does not appear relevant to your actions now.
3 - I am sure people can refer to the Arbcom case for the facts if they wish. I did review the situation with a sitting Arbcom member before starting RFA, as you are aware.
4 - This is the first time I have heard about it. It seems a bit late to be digging this up now.
5 - I know nothing about this, your page was not even on my watch-list until today.
6 - No, I was not even aware of """"revenge nominations"""". If I ever commented in a DR related to this, it was not as part of any pattern and I do not recall ever doing so. I do not watch everything you do on Commons, nor did I watch everything Russavia did. I am not Russavia, nor do I take responsibility for his actions. If you wish to have my help on Commons, please leave me a note there.
7 - I briefly looked at 's contributions to assess if he was active as an OTRS volunteer on Commons. The copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes, shocking for an OTRS volunteer granting verification tickets to images. This was self-evident even looking at the first 20 thumbnails, some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others. If you wish to discuss Ktr101's uploads to Commons, I suggest that happens on Commons.

Your 7 responses appear to avoid the central issue, which is how you are now using Wikipediocracy to hound me. You appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. If you have allegations to make, please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then I can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.

Again, you are digging through history, some of which is 7 years old and the most recent is now 3 years old. It would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud, most of which I have forgotten as I have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.

The Tea Leaf - Issue Four

Hi! Welcome to the fourth issue of The Tea Leaf, the official newsletter for the Teahouse! 

Teahouse pilot wraps up after 13 weeks After being piloted on English Wikipedia starting in February, the Teahouse wrapped up its pilot period on May 27, 2012. We expect this is just the beginning for the Teahouse and hope the project will continue to grow in the months to come!

Thank you and congratulations to all of the community members who participated - and continue to participate!

What you've all been waiting for: Teahouse Pilot Report is released! We look forward to your feedback on the methodology and outcomes of this pilot project.
....and if a pilot report wasn't enough, the Teahouse Pilot Metrics Report is out too! Dive into the numbers and survey results to learn about the impact the Teahouse has made on English Wikipedia.
Teahouse shows positive impact on new editor retention and engagement 

409 new editors participated during the entire pilot period, with about 40 new editors participating in the Teahouse per week.
Two weeks after participating, 33% of Teahouse guests are still active on Wikipedia, as opposed to 11% of a similar control group. 
New editors who participated in the Teahouse edit 10x the number of articles, make 7x more global edits, and 2x as much of their content survives on Wikipedia compared to the control group. 
Women participate in the Teahouse  28% of Teahouse participants were women, up from 9% of editors on Wikipedia in general, good news for this project which aimed to have impact on the gender gap too - but still lots to be done here!
New opportunities await for the Teahouse in phase two as the Teahouse team and Wikipedia community examine ways to improve, scale, and sustain the project. Opportunities for future work include:
Automating or semi-automating systems such as invites, metrics and archiving
Experimenting with more ways for new editors to discover the Teahouse
Building out the social and peer-to-peer aspects further, including exploring ways to make answering questions easier, creating more ways for new editors to help each other and for all participants to acknowledge each other's efforts
Growing volunteer capacity, continuing to transfer Teahouse administration tasks to volunteers whenever possible, and looking for new ways to make maintenance and participation easier for everyone.
Want to know how you can lend a hand at the Teahouse? Become a host! Learn more about what makes the Teahouse different than other help spaces on Wikipedia and see how you can help new editors by visiting here.
Say hello to the new guests at the Teahouse. Take the time to welcome and get to know the latest guests at the Teahouse. Drop off some wikilove to these editors today, as being welcomed by experienced editors is really encouraging to new Wikipedians.

 Rape is a gender-specific crime. In Scotland, it can only be committed by males upon females, which appears to mean by persons biologically male at birth upon persons born biologically female. It is, therefore, a crime of specific personal violence perpetrated on females. [...] The act of rape must consist of penetration of the victim's vagina by the accused's penis.

 Re: John von Neumann 

It does not fit in with other articles in this category: 3D Life, Block cellular automaton, Cellular automaton, Cellular image processing, Codd's cellular automaton, Conway's Game of Life, Day & Night, to name but a few. Generally speaking, the CA category appears to be divided between examples of cellular automata (Immigration (CA), QuadLife, Rule 110 cellular automaton) and terms related to cellular automata (Garden of Eden pattern, Gun (CA), Oscillator (CA)) - to such an extent that it might be best to divide this category into two subcategories. What you don't find in this category, however, are people who have contributed to cellular automata, regardless of their distinction. What we can do, however - I'll be glad to contribute, and it'd be nice if you helped to - is possibly create a subcategory, """"Scientists who have made a major contribution to cellular automata"""" (or, for preference, a shorter name, if you can come up with one), and in this category place Mr von Neumann.

What was challenging? 
For film's that propose questions about reality and controversy- an opportunity is deemed by users to not only post information about the film/actors/production, etc, but also to discuss themes present in the movie. Drifting away from that note, the article itself meets the standards to being a good article. There are little to none spelling errors, and information is almost spot-on with the right dates, people, and nomination facts. But that may be the overall problem of this article...is it too much factual based? Are people necessarily not focused on the article itself but rather the movie? In order to improve not only the article but the revisions to the essay, I will focus on how the film can compare to previous NASA space missions.
Possible Topics for Article Gravity (Film):

Imdb.com 

Factual Errors/ Scientific Accuracy
-Stars do not twinkle in the realms of space. If you are located on the earth’s surface, you might witness the twinkling of stars because of the earth’s atmosphere. 
-When Kowalski and Stone are stuck between cords in a spacecraft, Kowalski orders to be let go of and is then sent through space, floating away with decreasing oxygen levels. This is incorrect because both are in the same orbit, so a small tug would have worked to pull Kowalski toward safety. 
- When Dr. Stone gets back into the spacecraft, she initially takes off her spacesuit. Two parts are missing: Liquid Cooling & Ventilation Garment. In the film, Stone goes through an extreme amount of stress and excitement, leaving her to be awfully sweaty underneath her spacesuit. However, as she takes it off, there are no signs of sweat, which does not make sense.

There are several families of transposable repetitive elements. This article collectively calls them retrotransposons, and indeed several scientific articles agree with this definition. Searching a bit deeper, however, one finds a much more comprehensive and clarifying classification of these elements, whereby retrotransposons are only one class of them. According to this classification, proposed numerous times by scientists Brosius (an expert on the matter) and Stephen Gould, and followed by many other scientists specialized in this subject, all these elements are collectively referred to as retronuons. I am considering a thorough revision of this wikipedia article. I have made extensive research of the subject and the article seems to me very superficial and inaccurate. I won't do this until after a couple of months so that I finish my research and if someone has an objection to this s/he can say so here; I understand that wikipedia articles are not only for """"specialized"""" people, so its articles must sometimes be written in a way that seems inaccurate to the """"specialists"""".

Here are the three scholars' descriptions of what Rawat wanted to do as he grew older -
1. not allow others to dictate the direction and management of the movement.(Geaves)
2. manifest his own vision of development and growth. (Downton)
3. decide what direction the movement should take.(Melton)

and this desire caused

1. a deep rift in Prem Rawat’s family.(Geaves)
2. he had to encroach on his mother's territory and, given the fact that she was accustomed to having control, a fight was inevitable.(Downton)
3. a split between Maharaji and his family, ostensibly caused by his mother's inability to accept Maharaji's marriage to an American follower(Melton)

So how about """"As Rawat turned 16, his desire to decide to dictate the direction of the movement led to split with his mother. His marriage to an American follower in 1974 caused a permanent rift and his eldest brother gained control of Indian DLM in a lawsuit whilst Rawat retained control of Western DLM.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Edit Summary Request
I have noted that you edit without an edit summary. Please do your best to always fill in the summary field. This is considered an important guideline in Wikipedia. Even a short summary is better than no summary. An edit summary is even more important if you delete any text; otherwise, people may think you're being sneaky or even vandalizing. Also, mentioning one change but not another one can be misleading to someone who finds the other one more important; add """"and misc."""" to cover the other change(s).

 wikipedia's censorship 

I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_Back) just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section """"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest"""" Wakopedia says """"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group."""" the """"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say """"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.""""

Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph
2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI

Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled """"Jesus was a Homo"""", pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes """"ex-gay"""" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read """"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote 

""""Christphobia (from Greek Christós: Messiah; phóbos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.""""

I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts.

For this I received the following note from the admin

a4c97776e5b13e00,"Amanda: If you want to see controversial, try the articles dealing with the bible! But anyway, the way to go about editing is to begin by creating totally new sections to del with areas of the main subject that so far aren't represented in the article. Adding is far less likely to step on toes than subtracting. Other editors will judge the quality of your work and you'll gain acceptance as one of the team. Then when you've established your credibility, try re-organising existing material - amalgamate material that deals with the same subject but might appear in different sections, shorten paragraphs and improve syntax, and so on - but always trying not to delete more than is essential, and trying also to retain wikilinks. Finally, suggest deletion of any material you think is irrelevant or otherwise doesn't belong - this is where you'll probably find you have to compromise the most. As I said befoer, I have no books and no access to books, and so can't help you with drafting, but I do want to see Leo improved and I'll certainly help with editing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.  I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent).  Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

As to the portal, thanks for letting me know, I was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing, I thought it was transcluded.  Learn something new every day ;)

And lastly, I still think that it should be on the main page.  While I can understand Spencer's logic in that it needs more information to make it encyclopedic and not just news, I personally don't think that anymore should or could be added to the article on the Blagojevich scandal at the time and it is a pretty descriptive article.

Don't worry, it was just a typo with brackets omitted (a frequent case with the longer sentences or those involving a few disparate concepts. Also: the quotation marks were intentional, because ustaše were not negative (nor positive): it was a historical reaction of the part of the Croatian nationalist movemnent to the years of the Serbian oppression. To define it as """"negative"""" would be as absurd to define Soviet Communism, the most murderous regime on earth as """"negative"""" or """"positive"""". Those Croats and Bosnian Muslims who volunteered to take part in the Ustaška vojnica-more than 40.000 people in 1943.-cannot be labelled as war criminals, nor as traitors, as anti-Croat propaganda would have it in the Communist Yugoslavia period. The pathological murderers like Maks Luburić or totalitarian dictators like Ante Pavelić cannot cast the shadow on all the participants in the Ustaša military forces, any more than Joseph Mengele or Adolf Hitler can contaminate the memory of German soldiers, particularly Waffen SS who fought in the WW2. This is even more true about ordinary people or intellectuals who participated in the NDH regime (for instance, Adolfo Bratoljub Klaić, the author of famous dictionary of foreign words, or the sculptor Augustinčić, who made a bust of Pavelić, but later switched sides. Do I have to repeat ? The NDH was a quisling state. The vast majority of people involved with it and working for it were neither quislings nor criminals. And, this is just the NDH talk. Let's not forget that, as far as resistance movement goes, the Croats were the majority both in leadership and in fighting forces who were not forced to   join the resistance (like the Serbs in the NDH), but did it out of ideals. And, in the percentage of participation, heavily outnumbering other nations in ex-Yugoslavia-except, pehaps, Montenegrins: http://www.hercegbosna.org/engleski/ww2.html Hmmm...I haven't seen anything that would refute the claim that Serbian propagandists are vandalizing not a few wikipedia pages, solely with the aim of spreading anti-Croat chauvinist hatred.

 WikiCup and GA Reviews 

Hi J Milburn. I just noticed your post on White Shadows' talk page, coincidentally, just after completing a GA review. I wasn't aware they were worth points. Anyway, I was just wondering, what constitutes a review being worth points? Does a user have to cite specific examples for the nominator to fix? Make lots of suggestions? What happens when a person reviews a particularly good article that doesn't have problems at the good article level? I understand that the reviews are only worth 2 points; I'm just curious.

The spelling """"Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"...today's the last I'll be spreading"""" rather than """"spending"""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

Dude, generally speaking this has grown beyond that. I'm not sure, to me it just was suspicious that the numbers clearly contradicted themselves (and thus were in fact not reliable) but other unreliable sources (from seperatists) were not accepted. I suggested to Gloucester how at least the issue of whether or not the Speratists or the Ukranians broke the deal concerning peaceful withdrawl could be researched objectively but he wasn't interested. Saying that he is only interested in reposting things from """"reliable sources"""" (in this case unreliable). - This was in relation to a post of mine here that got deleted. Concerning this specific post...I'm not even sure what the seperatist are claiming atm but IMO it should be added. Anyway, every death in this sad war is a sad death. 78.68.210.173  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Supposing that the Koch brothers, to whommoney is no object, have some funds allocated in their PR efforts that include Wikipedia. Well, such editors are not going to be amenable to reason, because they would be being paid not to be reasonable.

Thanks for your comments.  You asked, """"Why single out RCOG""""?  That would be because the present article is about RCOG.

You asked, """"would you described these as pro-choice advocacy groups""""?  Please observe that my edit to this article said that RCOG took a """"pro-choice position"""" about a particular issue.  That is different from saying that RCOG is a """"pro-choice advocacy group.""""  KillerChihuahua pointed out that difference here.

I am not trying to avoid your question about the BMA, though it's not relevant in connection with the present article.  Yes, I would personally view the BMA as a pro-choice advocacy group.  After all, the report to which you refer states that, """"the BMA does not start off from a neutral position in this debate....the BMA has repeatedly since the 1970s agreed [sic] policy statements supporting the Abortion Act ... and calling for the legislation to be extended to Northern Ireland.""""

I admit that it is hypothetically possible that opposition to reducing abortion time limits might be motivated by concerns about late diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.  As you know, such abortions account for a very tiny fractions of abortions, but you're correct that concern about such situations could hypothetically cause someone to block a general reduction in time limits.

However, RCOG has said it is pro-choice, explicitly supporting """"rights of women to exercise personal choice.""""  RCOG has not only opposed reductions in abortion time limits, but has also sought to """"make abortions easier and faster.""""  It therefore would seem very odd to contend that RCOG has never taken any pro-choice positions. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello FlugKerl.  Congratulations on creating Richard VanGrunsven.  It is great article and well-sourced.  I have just done a little copy-editing.  The opening paragraph includes the following sentence: The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies.  Could you check the source cited for this sentence because I think the sentence contains an error?  It states that the number of Vans' aircraft """"produced each year in North America exceeds ... """" and compares it with """"all commercial general aviation companies.""""  Vans' aircraft are manufactured in large numbers by amateur builders all around the world, not just in the USA and Canada, so the large number of such aircraft produced annually shouldn't be confined to North America.  Secondly, if you are talking about """"all commercial general aviation companies"""" you are including such companies world-wide.  The number of aircraft produced by the world's general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because, outside North America, Europe and other English-speaking countries, aircraft manufacturers don't report their production statistices to anyone, and are not obliged to do so.  I suggest the sentence should say:
The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies in North America.

============

Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.'

The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.

The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.'

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' 

The older alien again warned his comrade saying, 'You probably don't want to do that! I really don't think you should make him mad.'

'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon at the pump and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Half an hour passed until he finally regained consciousness. Refocusing his three eyes, he straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you don't want to mess with a guy who can loop his penis over his shoulder and stick it in his ear.'

Evidence
Admin  was admonished in the  WebEx and Min_Zhu arbcom case """"not to use his administrative tools or give warnings in content disputes in which he is involved.""""   This is evidence of recent involvement in a content dispute, where FM reinserted a WP:BLP—WP:OR—WP:ATT violation (edit summary rv guettarda was correct) without participation in talk. (Furthermore, he  continued this behaviour against another editor in an unrelated issue, which Wales said was not warranted and worthy of a bigger discussion).  He is also  blocking outside the scope of the arbcom decision, even if one incorrectly asserts that I am party to it, including blocking (17 February 2007)  for contributing to (not voting!) a  deletion discussion; this was not an article, and participation is not disallowed.  FM then removed evidence that showed he was acting inappropriately.  He also made a previous block on 20 July 2006, incorrectly citing the arbcom decision of 'associated articles', while first providing no evidence, then false evidence (diff he provided was not to Ken Ham), to justify his accusation and inappropriate block.  (Note that KillerChihuahua removed evidence from that page, claiming that it was posted by a banned user, while no one in that decision was banned from Wikipedia; therefore, the removal was inappropriate.)  

 The reason and contest of the block is obviously that the blocking admin acted inappropriately by placing a block against someone on the 'other side' of a content dispute (and removing evidence by deleting a post that was not his own) in the first place.

I protest not for the sake of arguing but for the sake of independence, for the sake of speech freedom, for the sake of liberty. I returned to Wikipedia with this account as I said in my first contribution that """"[t]he first course of action I must take is pursue defense of my actions on my previous account"""". I was blocked before I had settled that matter. I had not had the chance to become a constructive editor because I was not finished with my pursuit of justice. However, cum laude I left my streak on Bode Miller to the first sentence with my only mainspace edit. My contribution to that renowned, reformed skier will prevail for many years to come. My first argument against my block is that Jpgordon, an involved administrator, blocked me. This is an utter no-no on Wikipedia — an involved administrator, who himself is the epitome of most administrators (abusive, unkind, and unjust [not a personal attack]), blocking someone he dislikes. Through my praxeological observations, I have realized that Josh clearly demonstrates cui bono. By this unjust block, Wikipedia is regressing, I daresay, regressing into the reign of terror.

I propose that this block be dealt with in one of two of the following ways:
My block be reduced to one month, several months, or even a year. If I really am not a constructive editor, I wouldn't return. As devoted as I am, I will always strive to become useful here.
My block be lifted. I will strive to make constructive additions to Bode Miller and other great Olympians. I will refrain from editing any talk pages so that I will not have any chance to """"troll"""" or """"harass"""". If I ever start trolling again, block me forthwith. After a couple months, allow me to edit talk pages again so I can work to develop mutual understanding with my fellow Wikipedians. Once I do anything you do not like, block me. How much vandalism can I inflict when at least six administrators are watching me?

My last request is that an uninvolved administrator adjudicate between Jpgordon and me. , , ,  (for their posts on my talk page) and  and  (for their posts at the Administrators' noticeboard) are now involved, so please find an uninvolved administrator to review this. 

If you worry about my not being constructive if I am unblocked, I ask that whoever is handling this request exsert those worries. After having been blocked for """"[d]isruptive editing"""" on my previous account, I returned with this one. I returned to make amends. I returned to set right everything I disordered. I returned to assert my concerns. I returned with the hope of maintaining this stately encyclopedia, and I partially fulfilled this here. I would like to continue perfecting this great community. My last hope when I returned was to get blocked again, this time indefinitely, but instead to participate in the creation of an online encyclopedia destined to become the essence of Internet, the essence of knowledge, and the essence of perfection.

As Carl Rogers once said, """"If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self-initiated learning"""". I believe just that and hope to introduce it to the Wikipedia community.

I sincerely apologize for my attacks (as you put them) at administrators. To , if you find problem with my username, if I get unblocked, I will be open to changing my username.
I am a man true to my word, so don't hesitate to unblock me. Thanks,    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

ce0f7b8231b6c2b1,"""Acupuncture HAS been proven effective in every single study ever conducted. The criticism that fanatic skeptics extremists have of it is that, while the difference between acupuncture and no treatment is very very large in every case, the difference between acupuncture and so-called """"sham"""" acupuncture is small, sometimes even clinically insignificant.

But this phenomenon makes total sense when we take into account the fact that this """"sham"""" acupuncture is not analogous to placebo at all, but in fact is strikingly similar to a very authentic traditional style of Japanese acupuncture (shallow needle insertion/non-penetration, alternate acupoint and meridian location, etc) that has been in common use for centuries are is still widely practiced to this very day.

The fact is, acupuncture is effective, and its silly to even try to test it against a placebo in the first place, because its not a pill or a drug or a substance that lends itself to such methodology. 

So what if some of acupuncture's effects originate in the mind? TCM theory itself states that, in therapy """"the mind leads the qi, the qi leads the blood"""", indeed predicting itself the main criticism that fanatic skeptic extremists have against it.

Its time to realise that Chinese Medicine is a valuable body of knowledge and lore, and to end the racism and xenophobia that insists that only Western culture is capable of developing an effective system of medicine. Afterall, if Chinese Medicine in so ineffective, how come the population of China is so much bigger than in Europe, where Western Medicine developed?

All this trouble just because DNyhagen wasn't allowed to plug his commercial website 

I think it's time that we get the Admins in on this.  We can't let one disgrunted commercial website owner, Dennis Nyhagen, reduce the value Wikipedia users get by robbing them of free OTR shows simply because he wasn't allowed to use Wikipedia to earn himself a few bucks by charging for the same shows.  Now that Denny is disgruntled he is attempting to destroy his """"competition"""" seeing how his """"competition"""" offers his """"services"""" to be given away for free. Denny, you see, some people do things for the good of the public, not to fill their pockets with $7.50/Gig downloads.  Wikipedia is a great example of that, although you may think that Wikipedia should charge users for access.  I couldn't help but read your website and how you insult visitors who download shows for free by calling them """"bottom feeders"""".  Denny, they are not bottom feeders.  Many of them simply don't have access to Paypal, or live on a fixed income, or live in a 3rd world country where your $7.50/Gig download translates into a lot of money in their local currency.

 It's really rather sad 

That I can ask an otherwise legitimate question on a talk page like this, but because one person does not like the way I phrased it, it is suddenly """"vandalism"""" and deleted completely.  If anything, you could say I was rude in the way I asked my question, but as far as I can tell, vandalism = intentionally disruptive edits, and, more importantly, edits to actual articles.  These talk pages are intended to talk, are they not?  The standards of writing something in an encyclopedic manner do not apply here.

At least from my understanding.

But even if they do, assuming that my post was solely created as a vandalism, when I was asking an otherwise legitimate question, is completely unnecessary.  Or are those policies such as """"WP:Assume Good Faith"""" or whatever all for show after all?  Seems very seldom that people actually do assume good faith around here.  They're just as happy to tag anything they don't like as vandalism, even more so if the person posting it isn't a regular.

I dunno, just a few observations.  I'll admit that I don't edit here often, so if I've somehow missed something that somehow changes the situation completely, feel free to let me know.

 Advice on editing 

I see that you have had what must be an unencouraging start to editing Wikipedia, with several articles you have created being deleted, and others replaced by redirects to existing articles. My advice to new editors is that it is best to start by making small improvements to existing articles, rather than creating new articles. That way any mistakes you make (which you will, because we all do) will be small ones, and you won't have the discouraging experience of repeatedly seeing hours of work deleted. Gradually, you will get to learn how Wikipedia works, and after a while you will know enough about what is acceptable to be able to write whole new articles without fear that they will be deleted. Over the years I have found that editors who start by making small changes to existing articles and work up from there have a far better chance of having a successful time here than those who jump right into creating new articles from the start.

 Michael Jackson 

About the new song, I'm not going to debate you about this because there shouldn't been any doubt in a few days. But I think you're being far, far too strict in your inclusion of information here. We don't have an exact confirmation by Michael Jackson that he sang the song. That's because, as far as I know, there wasn't much doubt. A singer is not going to release a statement """"Hey I sang this song"""" everytime a song that is suspected to be his is leaked. I doubt any singer will do that, much less Michael Jackson. And if Billboard Magazine and MTV news could confidently claim that it is sang by Michael Jackson, there is no doubt whatsoever. This similar reasoning should be applied to other things as well. Wikipedia relies on sources only when common sense does not suffice. We don't need exact statements on everything to merit their inclusion or notability.

On April 6, Nabil Sha'ath delivered a speech at a meeting of the Arab League, in which he charged that “a 'massacre' was underway in the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin.” (Deutsche Presse-Agentur) He also “compared Israeli actions in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus to the 1982 massacres of hundreds of Palestinans…” (The Associated Press). On April 7, Abdel Rahman told NBC’s Tim Russert, “The victims so far has been over 250 Palestinians killed, many of them are children and women.” Saeb Erekat is quoted by Washington Post as having said “This is not fighting between armies, but a massacre in Jenin camp.""""

 Citation quality 

First thing, I kiss the (virtual) feet of Wikidemon.  Thanks so very much for the wonderful cleanup of references yesterday!

Second thing, it seems like despite the heroic efforts, citations keep getting new problems with new edits.  WB74 inserted a bunch of footnotes to support the claim that 22 charges or convictions of ACORN workers have occurred.  Unfortunately, these facts seem firstly motivated by WP:TRUTH, and only secondarily by citations.  Nonetheless, I think something close to this number is probably right, and I have nothing against it being in the article (FWIW, it was me who edited a few days ago to say """"at least 15""""... I actually think the 'at least' is clarifying, but I'm not going to fight about those two words).

At some length on this talk page, WB74 provided lots of citations, most of them from far-right opinion publications rather than reliable sources.  In an edit today to the article, a somewhat different set of citations were provided.  These seem rather sloppily collected.  The first one I looked at was the wonderfully WP:RS NYT; however, once I read its body, I saw that it had nothing relevant to the 22 claim given in the sentence (it was about Ken Blackwell's stricter enforcement of registration requirements in 2006, perhaps in excess of the new laws according to the article).  It was an interesting article, just not one having anything to do with the sentence it was listed next to.

So I'll look through the rest of the added citations.  I urge other editors to also pay careful attention to the relevance and accuracy of citations added by a certain set of highly partisan editors.  There's wheat among the chaff, but we obviously can't assume that just because something points to, e.g. NYT it actually supports the point claimed. ×talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Reason for this article? 

Has anybody put forth a rational, NPOV argument for why this article's contents are incapable of being integrated into other articles about Japanese history and culture? We don't have articles for the Greek influence on Italian culture, the Chinese influence on Korean culture, the Indian influence on Chinese culture, the Arab influence on Persian culture, the Turkic influence on Anatolian culture, Japanese & American influence on modern Korean culture, etc. despite the fact that all of these influences were significant and frequently cited in academic literature - so why exactly is there a page for specifically ancient """"Korean"""" influence on """"Japanese"""" culture? I agree with the editors who state that the presence of such an article encourages tit-for-tat nationalism and it's as plain as day that such edit wars have already begun. Allowing this article to exist encourages future articles of the same sort and equally heated edit wars.

The real question is, how does the Palestinian leadership in the WB define recognition? Lately it's been kind of washy-washy. Hamas believes the simple presence of Jews in the ME is an occupation while Fatah is not as definitive. In the latest assembly there seems to be a lack of official consensus. The fighting between Abu and Net seems to be about the Jewishness of Israel. Abu recently said he does not recognize Israel as a Jewish state, and that is what irked the Israeli administration.

Actually, it is unquestionagbly mocking when someone comments about your being blocked, knowing that you cannot respond to them. Especially from an administrator. Why was ANY comment even necessary once I was already blocked, especially from the involved editor/admin who asked you to do it? I never said or even implied that everyone else was at fault; I apologized multiple times for sounding too harsh with the editor who's been adding the questionable content. Beyond that, my primary goal was to get this massive problem solved; massive because of how many articles are involved. I am in no way alone in my feelings on this issue. The large number of editors who have reverted the editor over the past four years is clear evidence of the objections. And now, Dennis is finally acknowledging that I am right on the content issue. He could have, and should have, just said that from the beginning so the other editor would hear it from someone who is very experienced about what is and isn't appropriate.

The Safavids (1501-1722) were a Turkic-speaking Shiite dynasty which ruled Iran from 1502 till 1722 (though several Safavid rulers were nominally reigning until 1736)[3]. The Safavid empire originated in the city of Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and had its origins in the Shiite Safaviyyeh Order. Safavids combined the elements of Turkic tribal militancy with Persian cultural identity and the Shiite teachings of Islam to assert the contemporary Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiite identity. During their reign, Safavids established a vast Iranian empire including the whole of modern Iran and the parts of modern Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, South Caucasus and Turkey.

Some of the facts should indeed have attribution, such as """"According to Khalifa,"""" and I have the books buried somewhere in this apartment. Let's look at the current tagged text, I'll start a subsection for each.   
using computers in 1968
Starting in 1968, Khalifa used computers to analyze the frequency of letters and words in the Qur'an.
1974 claim of numerical pattern
In 1974 he claimed that he discovered an intricate numerical pattern in the text of the Qur'an involving the number 19 mentioned in verse 30 of chapter 74 of the Qur'an.
This may be inaccurate, his original work on numeric pattern did not connect pattern to 30:74, but I'll check. What we may be seeing here is later synthesis.   
Details of claim
The details of this analysis including tables are available in the back of his book, Quran, the Final Testament.[2]
This was not tagged, but needs attention anyway
The details shifted over the years, and what was published in the Final Testament is quite different from the earlier publications. So it is not """"this analysis,"""" i.e., the 1974 analysis.   
Many popular magazines and newspapers
Many popular magazines and newspapers[which?] in the Muslim world reported his discoveries.
This doesn't need two tags. I'll pull the first.  
Other magazine and newspaper articles
Many other magazines and newspaper articles by and about Khalifa appeared throughout the world in many languages.
This is redundant, I'll yank it.   
Many Muslim organizations
Various Muslim organisations however have criticised Dr. Rashad's studies,[citation needed] accusing him of spreading heresy and ignorance through his proclamation of himself as a prophet

 Górny & Rosiknoń Witnesses to Mystery: Investigations Into Christ’s Relics 

Several editors tried to prevent including material from that book, voicing an opinion of the authors that """"the results of numerous time-consuming and comprehensive analyses, conducted using the most technologically advanced equipment available, seemed to coincide with assertions prevalent in Christian tradition."""", under the pretext of RS. For discussion of the matter, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Is_a_book_by_a_journalist_and_a_photographer_a_reliable_source_for_an_analysis_of_religious_relics.3F 

Ignatius is a serious Catholic publisher, I don't know why books published by them should be excluded from Wikipedia -except someone's hostility to Catholicism. If we exclude Górny, then we should also exclude Carrol-Cruz -catholic writer as well, and Nickell, sceptical writer, who is much more biased (against any relics) than any Catholic source -so his book is not the sort of book that should be used to write a neutral article. The statement is an opinion cited, not a fact. Besides there is no such academic discipline as study of the relics yet -anyone can publish whatever wants. In the lead, we have two negative opinions, by Erasmus from 1500s, and by Thurston from 1913. So the lead is not neutral. To balance it, we have posititve Górny&Rosiko;ń opinion from 2013 -much more recent, after several researches on some relics (described in their book) have been published.

b3abb55edfe85dbb,"Sinhalese Nagas 
It is very much founding fact that Sinhalese were unification of hela groups and sinha. Also it is very much famous fact that there were 4 hela groups in the island. Origins of the Hela Race. Hela was combination of Raksha, Yaksha, Deva, Naga. 

Raksha were extreamly powerful in the history but may be lost power due to battles,.. At the time of start writing the history, Raksha and Deva wasn't powerful. Naga was the most powerful authorities. That time only they had kingdoms. It is evident that they ruled two kingdoms Kelaniya and Jaffna. Others lived as small groups ( kuveni's story). 

Rajarata area was ruled by Yakshas before Vijaya. After 2,3 generations from Pandukabhaya, kings tend to suffix 'Tissa' and 'Naga' to their names. Tissa name is comes from Sinha tribe. There is no reason they added Naga to their names other than representing Naga tribe. This says later Naga royal families in one of the 2 kingdoms ( most probably Nagadeepa) made connections to the royal family in Rajarata. Nagas came to Anuradhapura and joined the Sinhas and Yakshas and actually able to dominate over others. So kingdom of Nagadeepa was lost from the history and Rajarata was trying to gain Naga/Sinha identity in which there had been a Yaksha rule. But kelaniya was there and ruled as maya rata.  

It is also very much evident Naga were the dominant tribe withing the core of the kingdom to protect their king. Those days without having clear power king can't survive. Yaksha's had clear control of Rajarata during the period of Pandukabhaya. But later Naga influence of the kingdom started to growth due to connection between royal families. Since conflicts between tribes hasn't been ended, Naga/Sinha king wasn't be a fool to rule middle of Yaksha on those days. Also we can see there is a clear discrimination against yakshas and had introduced a superiority on Nagas defining solosmasthana. Also some Yakshas leave the Rajarata and come other areas. Ritigal Jayasena was one of them.

So Nagas dominated over Rajarata and Maya rata but still others may had the control in Malaya rata and Ruhuna. SL was unified on tribe basis. After SL was converted to buddhism it wasn't required to unify tribes which based on religion. Since Ruhuna also accepted Buddhism (due to fear for Asoka) Rajarata king could made his brother ( MahaNaga) as the king of Ruhuna without considerable resistance. So it is very much evident that Sinhalese mainly consist of Nagas.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Being opposed to LGBT philosophy or movement doesn't make somebody an """"homophobe"""". Exactly as defending Israel policies doesn't make somebody a racist or being opposed to Judaism doesn't make somebody an """"antisemite"""". 
NB: Settleman, from recently you have started adding material from both sides but you don't comply with NPoV yet anyway. You have some ideas of what is the pov of opponents to some Israeli policies but when you write an article on such a topic, it is not enough to google for some articles about what they say. You have to understand their arguments as well as you understand those that you share/listen day-to-day and put all of them in article in order that everybody understand them. You also have to introduce their arguments """"fairly"""" so that they can be understood.
The big issue [for you] will be that on the statistical point of view, you should face 50% of time arguments from the other side partly stronger than the ones you believe in. How will you manage this if your are pro-Israel and revendicate this or the right to be so on wp ?

They were arrested for protesting in a place and time there was a ban on protesting.

Just like you are doing now, they are playing the victim to turn this whole thing into a """"look at the evil racist white devil"""" story, but on Wikipedia we are supposed to stick to the facts.
FACT is that in the Netherlands there are limits to when and where people are allowed to protest. This goes for neo Nazi's as much as for Zwarte Piet protesters. No source has been provided to support the claim that the reason for the arrest was anything other than breaking the protesting law.

 Cultural depictions of Johannes Gutenberg 

I've started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia's Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I'd like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.  Regards, ''' 

Clean-up and changes by Mukerjee Oct 18

A number of changes were made and the article was considerably cleaned up on
Oct 18:

 The claims of printing in Korea and China, largely unreferenced were referenced with extensive quotations
 The Biography section which was only a paragraph with other fragments scattered elsewhere was cleaned up (but still needs work). 
 The contributions of Gutenberg as the father of the printing press and a leading catalyst of the Renaissance have been under challenge from a number of quarters, this was presented with documentation
 The possibility that East-West traffic over the two preceding centuries of the Mongol Empire may have led to some knowledge in Europe of movable type  was introduced 
 A number of sentences and structures (such as the unwieldy initial paragraphs) were copyedited ruthlessly, merged with other fragments, and cleaned up. 

User Dicklyon reverts with the comment: too much of a change to do without discussion. 
This is not a criteria in Wikipedia, where ruthless editing is consistently
encouraged. 

Please justify in what way these changes are inappropriate and merge them by
putting in extensive work instead of just a revert. 

I am reverting back to the new version which certainly reads better, and has 
far better referencing and citations than the present version.  Please give
your reasons here; please do not blindly revert; edit''' the text 
to merge the elements you don't agree with.   It does not make sense to keep
the older inferior version that people are working with still.   

Such an extensive edit that throws out the stable work of many editors over many months, with no chance for incremental review and collaboration, is just too disruptive and disrespectful, in my opinion.  But I'll let someone else decide now whether to revert you again.  I recommend a revert, followed by you re-integrating changes piece by piece, with time between for reactions and negotiations.  

p.s. We don't need weasle words in the lead.  If it is verfiably true that """"Even within Europe, there are those who claim that Laurens Janszoon Coster of Holland may have used movable types earlier,"""" then you have to say WHO makes such a claim, and give a verifiable reference for it.  The things I have read about Coster did NOT say that anyone actually claims or believes that, only that it was a local legend for a while.  

I understand your angst at having many microscopic changes gone.  But the so-called """"stable"""" version read rather poorly, and at least the English and the flow is a lot cleaner.  There were repeated references (e.g. two consecutive parags referred to his family in Biog; the A&E; award had two references, etc), there were poor constructs,
and of course, the referencing was admittedly poor.  So please try to look at the whole picture.  Wikipedia says it right up front - edit the page only if you don't mind others """"ruthlessly"""" editing your text. 
As for the weasel word issue, this is what the current version reads (pls see the Biography section) - these were edits that were made before your comment here:

His business partner was Johann Fust who was more of a banker than a printer, but a 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster around 1940 and may have brought some of his equipment to Mainz",0,0,0,0,0,0

1e8e8847708b2932,"USS NAUTILUS SSN-571 Collision with USS ESSEX CVS-9, April 1967 

I was a junior officer serving in ESSEX in 1967 as a CICWO. At the time of the collision I was soundly asleep in the junior officer bunkroom tucked under the flight deck in the forward section of the ship (We were standing Port and Starboard watches under Condition 1 AS, a modifified form of anti-submarine battle stations) when a loud noise was heard and a brief shudder passed through ESSEX, a 29k ton anti-submarine aircraft carrier. ESSEX went promptly to general quarters which is standard operating procedure for protecting a naval ship in the case of a collision of unknown proportions or a fire not under control as the crew immediately mans their battle ststions, including manning damage control parties, and sets Condition Zebra which secures all water-tight hatches throughout the ship.

ESSEX, her task group comprised of several destroyer and destroyer escorts, and NAUTILUS were conducting exercises in the Virginia Capes Operations Area (VACAPESOPAREA. ESSEX was being replenished underway by a fleet oiler and both ships were being screened by the escorts. The wind was backing and the UNREP ships were altering ROMEO CORPEN (replenishment course) five degrees to port to put the relative wind 355 degree relative to their ship's head. NAUTILUS successfully penetrated the screen and was simulating torpedo attacks when she apparently miscalculated either her submerged depth and/or the course of the mainbody. NAUTILUS's conning tower struck ESSEX which draws 29 to 30 feet depending on how she is loaded, on the forward port quarter of her bow-mounted SONAR. NAUTILUS was believed to roll to starboard and to pass under ESSEX keel rerighting herself as she executed an emergency surfacing procedure in he vicinity of ESSEX elevator on her starboard side, some 500-600 feet from her bow. 

NAUTILUS appeared as though the forward leading corner of her sail area had been bitten cleanly off. Injuries were minor to two NAUTILOS crewman and to a Sonarman First Class in ESSEX. NAUTILUS did not suffer any apparent damage to her nuclear reactor or powerplant. No leaks of radioactive material were reported as testimony to her thorough construction. ESSEX's bow mounted sonar was badly dented/deformed but the ship's water-tight integrity was never breached, and she transited to the Boston Naval Shipyard for repairs and deployed in late May 1967 for an EASTLANT NATO Anti-submarine exercise (ASWEX).",0,0,0,0,0,0

  Sir/Maam:

Thank You ! For the heads up about needing to sign corrections to pages. All of the information I have added to the article on Walter Butler, the Loyalist, can easily be verified by using “www.footnote.com” for the Revolutionary Pension Applications or by consulting the """"Bloodied Mohawk"""", which Picton Press and I published in 2000, which footnotes the primary source document of every fact printed within the book. I think it important to note that the """"Pensioners"""" name possibly three different Patriots as the killer of Walter Butler. I have posted on my website “www.fort-plank.com” a page with all of the known references to Walter Butler's death which can be readily found in PRIMARY SOURCE materials. I hate using secondary and tertiary sources for obvious reasons and am very pleased that “wikipedia.org” has dramatically increased its documentation requirements for its articles! Thank You!

Please do not add original research or novel syntheses of previously published material to our articles as you apparently did to Walter Butler (Loyalist). Please cite a reliable source for all of your information. Thank you. Deconstructhis (talk) 

I must in all fairness ask what the problem is with “original research? Are you implying that original and authentic research is not appropriate for “Wikipedia”. There is way, way to much trash out there on the “internet” which cannot be, in any way, verified. My additions to the Butler page were not suppositions, rather eyewitness statements as to what really happened to Butler. 

Unfortunately, the webmaster of http://www.nyhistory.net/~drums/wbutler.htm is a personal and friendly acquaintance of mine, but he, and many other historians have bought into the early undocumented histories of the Mohawk Valley, most of which I have spent the last twenty-five plus years trying to authenticate as at least seventeen of my own ancestors fought in the Mohawk Valley during the Revolution, and regurgitated their unbelievable and unverifiable “facts” as their own research.

Please, do not misunderstand: I am not upset, get confused!!! I would really like to see all of the content of the Internet be so reliable that anyone could simply look it up on the web and then contact the repository of the original document, pay the appropriate fee for copying it, and then have their own private library of primary source documents.

Hope this finds all well!

P.S. The “copyrighted material” that I incorrectly posted in Wikipedia was an article entirely of my own production and which was copied from my master copies of the 100+ pages of primary source data on my “www.fort-plank.com” site. This can be easily verified by my publisher, Picton Press, and a plethora of fellow researchers, some of whom agree with me and some who do not.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The gall of some people is astounding: they've all become """"specialists"""" when they can hardly follow the Greek literature - because if they did you would be (a) dismissing Ethnologue's 1986 crap outright and (b) quoting the V-PRC survey which is recent and despite an obvious flaw of assuming no pluri-lingual descent/ability is the most recent and extensive statistical country-wide survey of use/understanding of non-Greek languages and significant Greek dialects in Greece to-date. If you were a specialist you would know that the US SD's """"estimate"""" is not the result of a survey (do you seriously believe that any type of similar survey by a foreign power into such a matter would have gone unnoticed and not being reported in the Greek media causing a diplomatic episode?) but the estimate based on visits to some parts of Macedonia (in Greece) of a certain diplomat (later to become infamous through a very public resignation) called Brady Keisling that single-handedly raised the profile of the issue in the SD's HR reports. If you were a specialist - instead of trying to guess numbers you would be giving the number of villages in which the language was spoken by at least some inhabitants according to the 1996 Euromosaic study (which your pal FPS has apparently read - but still has been unable to digest enough to add Arvanites in Thrace in his """"map"""").

Hi there, since you do not wish to have a united article representing all point of views and would like to stick to your point of view, I have no rights to prevent you other than that of a fellow wikipedian from South Asia. I have divided both the pages under discussion into two parts. One for Government point of view and one for refugee point of view. Since there is no neutral or united point of view, I will not be editing or discussing in those pages as actively as I have been doing. Besides, I can not prepare for my exams with no other than my fellow South Asian accusing me of fancy accusitions in place no other than wikipedia. Here is something that I have to say as regards your recent posts in this page:

 About:
Eukesh, you say all the right things, that we need a neutral article, that you want to be constructive, but at the end of it, it seems your mind is closed. You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available? you say you want to be constructive but you are already fixed in your view that all the ethnic nepalese people in the camps are from bhutan. FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed. you can count the number of poor nepalese without any documents who are finding their way to india every day. if ever there was a census to be done between nepal and india, you will find millions ‘stateless’ by your definition, definitely in the hundreds of thousands. is bhutan responsible for that? is it inconceivable to you that some of them might have made their way to bhutan? You conclude that it is 'entirely a Bhutanese issue' and nothing could be further from the truth. If nepal wasn't quite the economic basketcase it has become, maybe the rest of us in the region wouldn't have to deal with such an outflow of emigrants from your country. 

About:
 """"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet."""" 

Please do not comment about Nepalese press in a nation where it has played a major part in bringing a revolution from a nation where there is virtually no press. The press here is not garbage. However, I did not care about the Bhutanese refugee case until I found that it was missing here and thought of writing about it.

About:
 """"You say you have not read the garbage from the nepalese press but that you have done a lot of research on the internet. isn't that where all that garbage is available?""""

Wikipedia is available in net. Do you call it garbage? I have cited the information from sites of globally accepted bodies and not from the sites hosted by some pro- or anti- groups or some blog pages

FYI, if they’re not from Nepal, it could be they are from india also, ie, not necessarily from Bhutan. being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed.

I do not have a point of view. I agree that I have made some points which were offensive to some, but it was not intentional and were derived from the data. There was a speculation which was corrected later. I just posted what were there in websites of UNHCR and other global organizations which is something that is done in wikipedia. I have told you that people of Nepalese origin are found throughout the world. Many might be stateless. However, the reports of UNHCR shows otherwise in case of Bhutanese refugees. If you can change their view, please do. Otherwise stop editing with whatever you wish to write or in your own words, stop garbaging wikipedia.

 About """"being 'stateless' is not such a big thing in this region for which someone HAS to be blamed."""" Well, there is nothing which can top this sort of irresponsible comment.

 1RR 
East- I noticed this. Could you elaborate for me where you believe I violated my 1RR restriction? Thanks.   
Revert one, and two. It's a bit late to block you though, so just be more careful in the future. east718 // talk // email // 
Yes, those are two reverts; however, the 1RR restriction on myself was only in regards to Canadian monarchy articles, and PoC's edits, not to other pages or other editors. Now, though I was technically within my bounds there, having later read MangoJuice's comments to PoC on reverting and entitlement, I realise that the same applies to myself, and would have applied earlier. That second revert was a kneejerk retaliation to a move that was purposefully irritating, and, though technically allowed, was just a continuation of a dispute, rather than an effort to seek resolution. Anyway, I hope that clears things up.   

 Sorta like the 24.X fella 

 seems to be a single purpose IP editor.... reverting to his own version on several articles. A similar modus operandi to the 24.X IP fella you blocked the other day. Do you concur that this IP is a """"my way or the highway"""" editor? And can a nail belt be thrown across his current road? -speak politely 
Again, I don't think it's the same person. The edit-warring sure merits a block though. east718 // talk // email //

And from the page creator himself: Keep - It's a humourous cabal nothing more. Not meant for socialization, only discussions on how to improve Wikipedia among teen editors. eric (mailbox) 

He made the intent clear. He even edited the page to remove some of the parts that people had concerns about. The deletion supporters have nothing more than an assertion without any evidence.   
I don't really think that flies. Some people in favor of deleting did provide explanations: """"There is absolutely no intent [of improving the encyclopedia] here. It's purely a social page.""""; """"makes no indication of how it will improve Wikipedia"""".  Despite EricV89's claim that it was meant for """"only discussions on how to improve Wikipedia among teen editors,"""" this idea never saw a genesis",0,0,0,0,0,0

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.
I am well aware of the existance pederasty in many teachings of sufism and I have seen the pederastic sentiments in Jami and Saadi poems but Not all persian poets that follow sufism have pederastic inclinations!!.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Stillman inference 

a paragraph in the article, citing pp 14-16 of Stillman's 1979 work, reads as follows:

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself and avoid being accused of double standards given the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir. Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.

however, the only relevant discussion i found was this (p.15):

When all hope was gone they [i.e. Qurayza] sought to surrender on the same terms as had the Naḍīr. This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā c at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery. Muhammad then declared that this was none other than Allah's decision. Actually, it is clear from the Muslim sources that the Qurayza's fate had been decided even before their surrender. One of Muhammad's emissaries, Abū Lubāba, who had advised the Qurayẓa to give up, had to perform penance for hinting to the Jews what their real fate would be.

Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting, it was Sa'd (Aws chieftain) who was chosen to pronounce the judgement, as they may have been more accepting of the decree if it came from their tribal leader.again, with the second sentence in the article, i do not see how the solitary sentence discussing Abu Lubaba substantiates what has been written, or where Stillman is making any """"infer[ences]"""" that Banu Qurayza's fate had already been decided by Muhammad before their surrender.  
This is clear from the last two sentences of the excerpt. The first sentence states the conclusion; the second contains the premise.  Or 
could you also address the first point?  
This is clear from the following setences:This time the Prophet intended to make an example of them. He still could not act with complete disregard of public opinion. The degree of the Qurayẓa's treason was by no means clear. Muhammad had previously spared the Banū Qaynuqā at the request of their former allies the Khazraj. Many Awsites were now pleading that their former confederates be shown mercy. Always the master politician, Muhammad stepped aside and appointed Sa`d b. Mu`ādh to pass judgment upon them. Sa`d was a devout Muslim and a chieftain of the Aws, who was dying of wounds received during the siege against the Qurayza. Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.
 Or 
i have provided that extract above, and commented on it: Stillman doesn't state or imply that Muhammad deferred judgement to Sa'd in order to avoid accusations of double standards (especially when he openly endorsed the decision), so i believe this is original research. what seems more apparent is that, because of the Awsites protesting",0,0,0,0,0,0

""""The same day, he decertified all government employee unions by executive order, removing the requirement that State employees be union members, a requirement that had been in place since Governor Evan Bayh required by executive order in 1989.[26]""""

This statement is incorrect. The Executive Order that Bayh passed did not require employees to join the union, nor were they ever required to join. Also, the order was passed in 1990 so it is pretty much factually incorrect. Here is the link to Executive Order 03-35, which reprints the original executive order and extends it during Kernan's governing time period. They were required to pay at most 85% of union dues due to courtcase Nass v State, which I am also including a link to. However they were not technically members of the union simply covered by their collective bargaining agreements.

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Branched filaments.JPG. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cheers. I saw it in the larp book Playground Worlds, and followed the publisher back to the photographer and asked them to release it. The photographer very generously agreed, and the models did too. I like it because it captures some of the excitement of larp in an accessible way, and the genre depicted isn't one of the stereotypes (fantasy and vampire) but is still representative of a lot of larp out there - costumes, weapons, """"genre fiction"""", etc. Happy that the larp article has a face now.

 The reason I asked you about English being your first language - aside from using patently incorrect expressions like """"more clearer"""", opening a sentence with """"hence"""", lack of punctuation, or consistent non-capitalizing of """"I"""" as in first person - is the consistent misunderstanding we seem to be having about an elementary grammatical absurdity: since the theater is still within the US borders, the subsequent mentioning of the US should acknowledge that. My optimal solution is to change """"United States"""" to """"The rest of the United States"""". It is simple, elegantly worded, and solves the issue. EauZenCashHaveIt (I'm All Ears) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Please see following searchlight article Goodbye, racial nationalism, hello, ethno-nationalism. 

It is simply absurd to call the modern BNP white nationalists when they oppose white immigrants (e.g. poles, slovaks) entering UK.

Global encyclopaedia of political geography, M. A. Chaudhary, Gautam Chaudhary, Global Vision Publishing, 2009, p. 243 for example notes: """"Conversely, """"white nationalism"""" in Europe normally indicates a racial variant of an existing ethnic nationalism. For example, the British National Party opposes large-scale immigration of Russians and Poles, even though they are white'

So yes, the poltical ideology box needs to be updated to ethnic nationalism.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0
