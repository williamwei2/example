 Definition of Managment Consulting 

I've modified the paragraph discussing the types of firms to use the more narrow term """"strategy consulting"""" rather than """"management consulting"""".

Managment consulting currently has a very broad meaning.  IT, intellectual property management, law, and accounting all involve choices that can have a profound effect on the opportunities and resources of an organization.  In current usage it seems that the term """"management consulting"""" refers to any sort of consulting activity that

 has strategic implications for the future
 requires senior or upper level managment champions and buy in

To distinguish a Bain from a PWC we need to focus on difference between strategy and implementation.  Strategic IT, strategic IP management, and management accounting and other """"new"""" forms of consulting all have a blend of implementation and strategy in common.

I think what distinguishes a Bain from a PWC is Bain's exclusive focus on the strategic elements of a problem.  Bain will tell you why you need to do something and some general ideas of how given your current resources but leave the rest to you.  Firms like PWC and  Proudfoot have built their reputation on taking at least joint responsibility for the implementation.

Hey brownaddictUK, welcome to wikipedia. I've noticed that you put the www.helpingaddicts.net link on a couple of pages that I watch over, and wanted to give you a quick heads up on editing wikipedia.  as you've probably noticed, a lot of the links were pretty quickly removed by editors because this isn't the place for them.  I'm all for harm minimisation & abstaining from addictions, but this is a place to provide factual information on subjects.  To put a link to an external link to a website, it has to have some further specific information about a subject, or for the purpose of verfiying information in the article.  The website you added doesn't fit either of these categories.

But i would like to invite you to contribute factual information to wikipedia, judging by the list of articles you added the link to, you seem to have a fairly good knowledge of drug related issues, maybe you could share that by contributing to articles.

I'm a reasonable and civil professional. Address me in a civil tongue or don't address me at all.

For example, one of these falsehoods covers the notion that the Welsh population is huge in Argentina when in reality it is not as significant at all in numbers as the author of the 'Argentina' piece makes it out to be. Another false notion within the same piece - both explicit and implied - is that Italians are the majority ethnic race in Argentina, when again, the numbers show this is not the case. These and other idiocies which aren't true exemplify the need to update the info therein. Third of all, I read your bio. With all due respect, according to your ethnic background, you're not qualified to dictate the origins of other nation's histories, especially Euopean. I know my English and Spaniard history. You don't. I may sound like I'm talking out of line here, but seriously, I'm not. Don't take offense as I state the facts as I see them. This is why modification is necessary.

They receive the affect of the words and they need to propose the alternatives. Put in simple terms that everyone can understand - males define the things that constitute masculinity and women define the things that constitute femininity. Lad mags are not written by women and Elle is not written by men. In other words those who are of the """"thing"""" itself usually occupy the best position to discuss the """"thing"""" (you can replace """"thing"""" with any term you want - airline pilots, hockey players, turnip growers, bee keepers, etc). This is not a guideline issue - this is a universal issue that affects us all but doubly affects those described as such. To remove this to a Guideline Talk Page would be counter-productive. For example: If the Suffragettes had not made the issue of votes for women visible to the wider public through highly visible protests including hunger strikes, imprisonment, direct action which included breaking laws (read: guidelines) then ALL women would not have the vote. There is no need for self-immolation as the Tibetan monks have done to highlight their continued oppression under the Chinese authorities - we just need to set this article alight.

Speedy deletion of Kaleb Young
 A tag has been placed on Kaleb Young requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

I would request and assistance regarding distributive editing by M.A.R 1993 on multiple India-Pakistan related pages. I have written about the problem here for his OR addition on Operation Dwarka. He is also removing sources on Operation Dwarka and Battle of Lahore. I had worked on these for a very long time and these are articles where reliable sources are not easy to find so removal of source would render the article without any references. On article like Indo-Pakistani War of 1965‎ where neutral reliable sources are easily available he is removing any highly reliable neutral (non-Indian and non-Pakistani) source like BBC and instead adding Pakistani source. I have invited him to talk pages of the articles to proceed to dispute resolution but he does not seem to be interested in that.

Hi there. As the creator of the page, I got one of those newfangled notification thingies when you templated the article. Could you be a little more specific about what you feel the problem areas are? The tag you used implies that the problem is that there are references, but they're not inline citations - but they're all inline already. Your edit summary said that it should have more footnotes, by which I assume you mean references cited. I know there's no hard and fast rules about that stuff, but six isn't too bad for a start-class article and every paragraph is supported by at least one reference, so I'm thinking there must be something specific that you feel isn't covered adequately. Could you elaborate a bit (here, or maybe the article talk page would be better)?

I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles """"publicly identify with the belief in question"""" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said """"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian."""" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [""""Leo Strauss"""" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word """"Straussian"""" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word """"Straussian""""? I don't think being a Straussian is anything to be ashamed of, but I don't like to see the Wikipedia being used for POV pushing by people who misunderstand Strauss. Thank you for the civil reply.

Dear Yiyu,

Don't work too much on the Mao article here  whatever you agree on will have no real strength behind it because you are not working with other editors, and when you polish something together, it will ultimately be destroyed by those that had no part in it.

You also need to watch out for what wikipedia calls """"weasel terms"""" that are used in the draft above.   """"weasel terms"""" are ways of saying thing that really avoid the issue.  If an editor says """"some analysts believe"""", it really means """"I don't know who believes it, but I want it in this article"""".

Unfortunately, the current wiki has no way to decide """"truth"""" and """"lies"""".   The best you can do is present all sides (not just one, or two) and cite evidence.     For everything that is a lie, you can add sentences describing why it is untrue.  There have been some movements to give weight to editors that are educated in one area more than those that are just shooting their mouths off, but they have failed.  As we all know, many times history has been distorted and many people have been fooled, so don't be too sure that you know what really happened, when all most of us really have are hand-me-down stories.

Lastly, be sure not to get too wrapped up in articles.  Find other articles to edit and your experience will be much more fulfilling.   Come to visit Mao often, and put it on your watchlist, but don't let it consume you or sour you on wikipedia.   I can guarantee you that 10 years from now, there will STILL be edit wars on the Mao page.  Working through the night to make a perfect article won't stop someone from getting up in the morning and ruining your delicate balancing act.  You probably have great insight into many things that are completely uncovered in Wiki  give those a try sometime.

Rump PC caucus
Following the merger, a rump Progressive Conservative caucus remained in Parliament, consisting of individuals who declined to join the new Conservative Party. In the House of Commons, Joe Clark, André Bachand and John Herron sat as PC members.

In the 2004 election, Bachand and Clark did not to run for re-election, and Herron ran as a Liberal, losing to Rob Moore in his riding of Fundy—Royal. Scott Brison, who had joined the Liberal caucus immediately upon departing the Conservative Party, was reelected as a Liberal in the 2004 election.

In the Senate, William Doody, Lowell Murray and Norman Atkins also declined to join the new party, and continue to sit as Progressive Conservative senators. On March 24, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed nine new senators, two of whom, Nancy Ruth and Elaine McCoy, were designated as Progressive Conservatives. Thus there may be Progressive Conservative senators until 2021 when McCoy, the youngest of the five, attains the mandatory retirement age of 75, or later if subsequent senators designate themselves Progressive Conservatives. Nancy Ruth has since left to sit with the Conservative Party. Adding the death of Senator Doody on December 27, 2005, this reduced the number of PC Senators to three.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Identity of the designer 

The paragraph just above the heading """"Origins of the term"""" states:

""""Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation — it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god.[34][22][35] Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.""""

The above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer. ID leaders have indeed named the designer. 

The article's reference #34 above is to Dembski's 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that """"intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory."""" When Dembski said that, he was identifying, indeed defining, the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ, to which """"Logos"""" refers in the Gospel of John, as Barbara Forrest points out on pp. 3-4 of her paper http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf.

See also the article's reference #142 at pp. 39-40 of """"Is It Science Yet? Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution,"""" at  http://law.wustl.edu/WULQ/83-1/p%201%20Brauer%20Forrest%20Gey%20book%20pages.pdf.  Note here also that Phillip Johnson also defines ID as requiring God when he defines it as """"theistic realism.""""

So it is clear that it is more than """"a personal view of many proponents"""" that the designer is the Christian God.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The current lead implies Israeli aggression against Hamas by stating that Israel killed several Hamas members in Khan Yunis on July 6, and Hamas retaliated with rockets. I have been trying to seek consensus for including the Israeli claim that Hamas started firing rockets circa June 30 at DRN. However, it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels: """"Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israel's deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died, though Israel denied any involvement...The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted """"terror sites and concealed rocket launchers"""" in the enclave, but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where the Hamas gunmen died. Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel."""" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: """"When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation."""" Hamas' claim that seven of its members were killed by an Israeli airstrike is not an assertion Wikipedia should parrot uncritically.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

But we have to consider the fact that these research reviews each looked at a different corpus, which isn't clear in the current version. Here is what Cochrane 2006 says:
 """"Inclusion criteria: Adults with a primary diagnosis of anxiety disorder (or corresponding to another diagnostic criteria including Diagnostic and Statistical ofMental disorders (DSM), International Classification of Disease -9(ICD-9) or ICD-10 clinical descriptions or research diagnostic criteria for neurotic disorders) with or without another comorbid psychiatric conditions, irrespective of gender, age, race or nationality.""""
The authors' criterion for inclusion was that the individuals in the study have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. They were psychiatric patients. That's why they excluded for consideration 46 of the 50 studies on anxiety that they found. They only wanted those studies on adults with a specific diagnosis: """"Using the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorder (DSM or ICD classification) and limited to include only Randomised Controlled Trials, 46 studies were excluded from the early phase."""" Of the four studies that remained, one was on TM. Cochrane looked at a single study on TM.

Eppley looked at every study on TM that related to anxiety. Most of these were nonclinical studies, that is, they included subjects that hadn't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. These studies, both meditation and relaxation, most commonly used the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a standardized assessment of anxiety levels that's been validated in hundreds of studies, to assess the level of anxiety in the subjects. His meta-analysis included 35 studies on TM. In sum, the best way to represent these sources is to make it clear that they were looking at different populations of subjects, and hence, different groups of studies.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately your point of view is not correct. I won't say it is hypocrisy though, it might be rude... 
I am not, but you are, comparing these two incidents... What I am saying is in these two cases Europian has different standards. I cannot see what is hard for you to see in this?

 AfD for Firearms (computer game) 

Please consider removing your AfD request for the firearms computer game. It's a highly notable mod: It won PC Gamer's mod of the year, was released on CD from valve, and at one point in time was the #3 most played halflife mod (before DoD came out, and that pushed it back to #4). It's been around for years. I notice from your user page you state you are only 13 years old. Firearms would have been largely before your time. Please see forums.worldatwarmod.com and check the Firearms section for evidence of notability. Thanks.  SWATJester  Ready  Aim  Fire! 

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/True Combat: Elite 
As per your comments here, it's obvious you flooded AfD with several mod articles as retaliation for your article being nominated. This is unnacceptable behavior, and if you continue to show such aggression, you may be blocked in the future.  
Call it what you want, the fact is you basically admit to doing it to prove a point in SEVERAL places. Whatever your reasoning for it is, the plain fact is that its against wikipedia policy, no matter how you sugercoat it.  
 Hi 
I would like to ask one person who voted on True Combat: Elite deleting. Do you even play games? Have you even heard about the mod? Have you checked anything about it? Have you seen my phat and big comment where I mentioned a lot of obvious reasons for notability. You don't have to answer. I know the answer.  [talk] 
Since I voted, further evidence of notability has been added so I have changed to a keep vote.  

On the same subject, the article was kept per the afd, but you might want to establish the notability further on the article itself (by including some references to it on notable sites etc.) so that someone else won't just nominate it again in a few weeks. Thanks. -

 Thomas Jefferson - Paleontologist 

I propose adding Paleontologist to the Categories. From the Wikipedia article, Vertebrate paleontology:

Thomas Jefferson is credited with initiating the science of vertebrate paleontology in the United States with the reading of a paper to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1797. Jefferson presented fossil bones of a ground sloth found in a cave in western Virginia and named the genus (Megalonyx). The species was ultimately named Megalonyx jeffersonii in his honor.Jefferson, Thomas, """"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia"""", Read before the American Philosophical Society, March 10, 1797. The """"certain bones"""" consisted of three large claws and associated smaller bones. He theorized that they were the remains of an extinct lion which he named Megalonyx (""""giant claw""""). In 1799, Dr. Caspar Wistar correctly identified the remains as belonging to a giant ground sloth. In 1822 Wistar officially named it Megalonyx jeffersonii.Jefferson, Thomas (1799), """"A Memoir on the Discovery of Certain Bones of a Quadruped of the Clawed Kind in the Western Parts of Virginia"""", Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 4 pp. 246-260.Wistar, Caspar (1799), """"A Description of the Bones Deposited, by the President, in the Museum of the Society, and Represented in the Annexed Plates"""", Transactions, pp. 526-531, plates. Jefferson corresponded with Cuvier, including sending him a shipment of highly desirable bones of the American mastodon and the woolly mammoth.Rice, Howard C, Jr., """"Jefferson's Gift of Fossils to the Museum of Natural History in Paris,"""" Proceeding of the American Philosophical Society, 95 (1958): 597-627.

He also carried on a well known lively debate and correspondence with Buffon, and engaged others, including Lewis and Clark, to procure specimens for study. He is just as much the Father of American Paleontology as he is the Father of American Architecture, neither for which is he primarily known, nor from which he deign make a livelihood.

ISSO 1999-2001
This was an operation done with full knowledge of top levels of the USG Intelligence Community who monitored it. Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of """"Russian torsion field weapons"""" and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on """"The Philadelphia Experiment"""" and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the """"saucers"""" really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper """"On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics"""". pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in """"this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics"""" to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005""",0,0,0,0,0,0

You, like 'Dodo', are wrong.  Notice that 'Dodo' hasn't bothered to EXPLAIN, in  detail, his actions.  This is quite revealing!  He must know that I am a 'new' user:  Only on for about two weeks.  Logic suggests that he should, carefully, EXPLAIN why he did something like deleting my posts, repeatedly, without even as much as asking the community.  After all, why should he be RUDE, as he has been, when he cannot claim that I 'should know' not merely what the rules say, but also the way they are followed.  Well, the simple answer may be that he does this kind of thing a lot:  He may ORIGINALLY have been respectful, but maybe he's developed a practice of 'drive-by-edits'.  He seems to have that reputation!  But as tempting as it may be to assert that, I think his actions are far more detailed and specific, and malicious:  His pattern of deletion of my posts is to delete ALL ALL ALL of my posts, not merely some fraction that (he would argue) violates some rule. So, the 'rule' (actually, the practice) he seems to be showing is this:  """"Do not allow James Dalton Bell to post ANYTHING, on any article, and certainly not on 'jim bell'.""""  Will 'Dodo' deny this? So far, he's avoided commenting!  'Dodo' seems to do this by simply finding SOME reason to dislike my post (even just a small part of it, though he doesn't say), and then use this to 'justify' deleting everything.  The best explanation, I  think, is that somebody has put him up to it, and he wasn't careful enough to cover his tracks.  And, a few other non-thinkers back him up.

 Your edits to Robert Byrd 

I had to revert your edits to the above article for a number of reasons. First of all, articles must conform to WP:NPOV and be writted from a neutral point of view. This applies to critics of his record and supporters that seek to apologize for his past actions. As per Wikipedia policy, the burdern of proof would be on Byrd's critics, and not the senator, regarding whether or not he is still involved in the Klan. Any such implication without a source that he is still a member would, therefore, violate WP:V. Also, the placing of the comment in the first paragraph would violate WP:LEAD. 

Furthermore, the part about Marshall and Thomas is in fact in the article, as (regardless of what his backers may feel) pertinent to his record and is written according to WP policy. While the comments about the other nominees are arguable, you could, if well-sourced (which wouldn't be hard to do), find a quote from respected conservative civil rights activist Niger Innis that called his opposition to Rice and others """"racist"""". You could say something like """"His opposition to (whoever) was Labled as racist by Niger Innis, a spokeperson for CORE.""""

""""kbs"""" suggests """"kilo-byte seconds"""" or """"kilo-bit seconds"""" ... but both are nonsense units (should be either kbps or kb/s).  Similarly, """"mbs"""" suggests """"milli-byte seconds"""" or """"milli-bit seconds"""" which is doubly nonsense - both because it is a nonsense unit and also because (even if they mean mbps or mb/s) it is a ridiculously small unit.  I realize that they probably mean """"Mega"""" rather than """"milli"""" - but then they should use capital """"M"""".

""""Baud"""" used to be used universally for data transmission rates, and that is, at least, unambiguous.

This is all very sloppy and, of course, does not reflect well on GlobalScape.

You had mentioned that it would be a big improvement, and so I was wondering if this would change your support regarding deletion. Even if it is not perfect right now, there is a need for something other than AfDs to handle these articles, and this is a process that will only continue to improve. If something doesn't make sense, we'll change it. If people are being excluded, we'll change it.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.

As for the question, if races exist, the answer is clear: Races don't exist, because Spencer Wells, Guido Barbujani and Alan Templeton say they don't. Every other opinion is a misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots. Well, there are few seemingly racial clusters appearing in recent genetic studies, and they very well agree with the classical anthropological division of humans. Furthermore, when geographical distance is constant, the genetic distance between groups within these clusters is several times lower than between groups from different clusters. The main detected bareers of genetic flow are also consistent with the borders of traditional races. Moreover, the genetic distances between these clusters are typical for mammals routinely divided into subscpecies by biologists. However, this all must be due to some misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots, because Spencer Wells, Guido Barbujani and Alan Templeton say that race doesn't exist.   22:56, 22 April",0,0,0,0,0,0

99d98bd28aed53b4,"Context of the Women's Health Movement 
I think it is important to note the context of which Carol Downer figured out how to do vaginal self-exam and menstrual extraction during the woman’s health movement at this time, the early 1970’s, abortion, birth control and fertility information were not available to women. In addition, there were an estimated 5000 deaths a year from illegal abortion. This concept helped put reproduction and the woman’s body back into the hands of the woman in a safe way. I also feel as though some of the language used in this article has a negative connotation. For example, when it is stated that she “promoted a procedure called menstrual extraction... if she were pregnant, this would constitute a non-professional abortion.” it sounds as if the article is trying to claim that she promoted abortions, which isn’t necessarily true. What she did promote was women reclaiming their bodies and taking them out of the hands of the male-dominated medical world and into their own. She PROVIDED women with means to learn about their bodies at a time where birth control did not exist. I also think it should be noted that after Roe v. Wade, she traveled to Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico, to name a few, and attended national and international conferences as advocates of women’s health rights. In addition, I think it should be specified what the Roe v. Wade decision entailed, and how it made abortion legalized so she was therefore able to establish the women-run clinics. Roe v. Wade has a Wikipedia article and can be linked. 

These contributions are important because the context all of this was a very important time in Women’s Health History. Mentioning the context of the women’s health movement and how she was providing women with the means to take control of their fertility and reproduction when they had no other means to do so and could even face legal persecutions if they did. By adding this, the article will make more sense, especially because it mentions her arrest and things like the Roe v. Wade trial.

From an ES/WGS perspective, the revolutionary time where woman began to take back the control of their bodies. There are many misconceptions around things like abortion even still today. Woman have been criminalized for performing or having abortions in history and even today. And I think it is important to take note of that. Also, Carol Downer has played such a crucial role in Women’s Health and Feminist activism, I was surprised at how short her article was. I also think that The Women’s Health Movement should have it’s own article on Wikipedia (currently there is “Feminist health centers” and “Women’s Health” and “Feminist Movement”)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi I just wanted to comment on the organization of this stub. I think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. Also, none of the information under """"Applications"""" is cited. If this section wasn't written by you and you haven't found any evidence to support these statements, then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. Under references, """"Reference List"""" is misspelled. Also, it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. If you could incorporate more images to this topic, that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory. The analogies in """"The Hologram and Holonomy"""" under Theory Overview was very helpful to understand the concept.

11873bff44b41a65,""":: uhhh, we could also add Standford Shaw on the list and last time I checked, he was a western scholar. As for the rest of your text Mr. Kojian, the fact of the matter remains that there is no concrete evidence written or otherwise that the Ottoman goverment of the time gave explicit or even implicit instructions to exterminate the community of Armenians for racial reasons. Until a time comes where there is substantiative proof that such instructions were given, it is totally misleading to coin the term genocide to the tragic events that unfolded in 1915-16. And it doesnt matter if there were a zillion eyewitnesses who funny enough all turn up to be christians, the most famous of which was Lepsius the racist protestant who was obsessed with preserving the """"good image"""" of Germany.  

 No evidence?  Oh brother.  Have you read the article?  Believe me, every Armenian in Anatolia did not commit suicide to make Muslims look bad, and Germany look good.  I'm glad you admit though that you don't care if there were a zillion eyewitnesses, since you know better than the people who saw it with their own eyes.   

 I dont think you get my point which is that your sources of the period in question may very well have been biased maybe? You have to get rid of the typical mindset of  if it supports the genocide thesis, it must be an objective, unbiased source! If not, it has to be someone that is in the Turkish goverment payrolls! This approach of yours and most of those that support the genocide thesis is far from being constructive and is one of the reasons that this issue is not being addressed properly!  

 Addressed properly? Go ahead and address this.  Did the population of Armenians in Anatolia drop from around 2 million to around zero during WWI and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey?  And did that drop in population take place due directly to actions of Ottoman/Turkish authorities?  Yes or no.  No maybes, no yes but, no nothing else. There is no justification for genocide, and we don't even need Christian eyewitnesses to tell us that the Armenians are gone - while the Turks and Kurds were fruitful and multiplied.   

 First of all your figure on the number of Armenians in Anatolia is grossly exagerated, Ottoman census figures before the war put the total at below 1 million in the eastern provinces. Even the Armenian patriarchate put the figure slightly above a million so I dont know where you dug that ridiculous sum from (could be your mind playing tricks which happens when you are exposed to too much propaganda)! As for the numbers dropping close to zero, if its the eastern provinces you are referring to, its what seems to have happened as a result of relocation. Have you even bothered to read through the information provided from the Ottoman archives in the links under the section on those that oppose the genocide thesis? If not, it would very well explain your flawed opinion on this subject!  

In theory the edit is not so bad. But the problem is that it only gives credance to those that say the events aren't """"settled"""". There needs to be an equal amount of discussion on those that say these things did happen, at the very least. And, to be honest, the edit just throws names around - there's nothing in the articles to say that they have a particular position.  

 Hellooo, this is the OPPOSITION section of the article. You can include the names of 'scholars' accepting it in the academic recognition section, I've no problem with that. These scholars exactly say the following in their declaration (word-by-word) """"The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direct of serious inter communal warfare (perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces), complicated by disease, famine, suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War. Indeed, throughout the years in question, the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy, which has gone on in Lebanon for the past decade. The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense. But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent, and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population, Christian and Muslim alike.

Since it's a depiction of a sex act and it's being distributed, this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions.  Nothing about it, however, is inherently hyperreal.

""""BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — Moammar Gadhafi loyalists seized control of a Libyan city and raised the ousted regime's green flag, an official and military commanders said Tuesday, in the most serious revolt yet against the country's government.

The retaking of Bani Walid highlights the vulnerability of Libya's new leaders, who have faced mounting criticism as they struggle to unify the oil-rich North African nations and build state institutions from scratch three months after Gadhafi was captured and killed.

The seizure also appeared to be the first major, organized operation by armed remnants of Gadhafi's regime, adding to the security woes of the ruling National Transitional Council. The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces. Instead it is left reliant on multiple """"revolutionary brigades,"""" militias made up of citizens-turned-fighters, usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood.

The militias were created during the months of civil war against Gadhafi's forces last year and when the war ended in October, the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated. Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.

Hundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.

On Monday's attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.

The revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.""""The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,"""" said the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.

A top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.The three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.

'''A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, said al-Fatmani.""""

""""If in the subsequent period the Poles are judged to have contributed to the catastrophe themselves, it was more by their desperate efforts to ecape from ANarchy, than from their supposed desire to wallow in it. It should have been clear to all that the despots of St.Petersburg and Berlin, who denied most civil liberties to their own subjects, could never be the genuine champions of any """"Golden Freedom in Poland""""
The same sort of hypocrisy was current in matters of religion. It is true that the Roman Catholic establishment of the Republic, despite the long tradition of toleration and freedom of worship, had denied the religious minorities, Orthodox and Protestant, full political rights since 1917. In this, Polish practices resembled that of Great Britain or Holland, and until bishops were goaded into retaliation in the 1770s, had been far more tolerant that that of Russia, whose visiting armies had invariably inflicted forcible conversion on the Republic's Uniates.

 East Jerusalem and Golan Heights

The article states as follows:

""""Military occupation is effective provisional control of a certain power over a territory which is not under the formal sovereignty of that entity, without the volition of the actual sovereign.[2][3][4] Military occupation is distinguished from annexation by its intended temporary nature (i.e. no claim for permanent sovereignty), by its military nature, and by citizenship rights of the controlling power not being conferred upon the subjugated population.""""

Therefore, if a country annexes a territory AND grants citizenship, that territory should NOT be placed in this list. (That does NOT mean it's not occupied, but it is NOT military occupation.) East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights have been annexed by Israel and the residents have been granted FULL citizenship by Israel.

Bohr's Philosophy
Hello and thanks for your critique on my slight, though important changes to the article. I'd like to comment that previous to my changes, the particular part was absolute horrible writing, strictly from a stylistic point of of view, while my changes morphed that into a well balanced, clean structure that semantically integrated into the overall flow of the previous text. Furthermore, your deletion, based on arguable and vague stylistic opinion while ignoring a more important semantic correction—without which many are misled to believe that Bohr was an atheist unarguably—makes you appear to have done it in an attempt of an ideological censorship. Although I'm sure you have had no such intentions, your removal of only one side of the story points directly to your own dogmas on the subject.

As someone who, I believe, appreciates freedom of speech and honest representation of views in Wikipedia, you can understand my arguments. If you wish to discuss the style of the change, I'm more than open to discuss it with you, but I think your fine reputation ought to prevent you from silently deleting it in the future. Therefore, relying on it, I'm reposting the correction, which we can later collaboratively polish to your liking.

Finally, as we are on the subject, I have done an extensive search, and to my knowledge Bohr never called himself an atheist, and the references for this statement """"Bohr's disagreements with the philosopher mostly stemmed from Bohr's atheism"""" seem completely unsupportive of the thesis—statements by anybody but the man himself can hardly prove such a blunt declaration about such rigorous subjects as religion and philosophy. What are your thoughts on that?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on.

Hi! I see that you were one of the participants in the recent AfD on the article Christianity and Judaism.  That AfD recommended (in a snowball result) that the article be merged into Judeo-Christian.  However, since the AfD concerns have been raised, most notably
 Per WP:ADJECTIVE and WP:MOSNAME, we use nouns and noun-phrases for article titles, not adjectives.  So a general survey on the relationships between Christianity and Judaism (a topic this encyclopedia should certainly cover) should be called Christianity and Judaism, as per the articles Christianity and Islam, Islam and Judaism.
 The reason the article Judeo-Christian exists, as its own hatnote declares, is specifically to survey the history and use of that word-phrase  which has its own controversy, and its own tale to tell.  (See here where I've set things out in a bit more detail.)  That story is a good fit for its own article, and will get completely lost if the contents of Christianity and Judaism get inappropriately dumped on top of it.

Having contacted the closing admin, his advice was to open a new discussion at Talk:Christianity and Judaism, advertise the discussion widely, and if a new consensus can be reached in that discussion [his emphasis], then per WP:CCC the new consensus should be followed, rather than the AfD decision, without the need for a DRV or a new AfD.

Concerns about the proposed merge have also been expressed by ,  and .

This post is therefore to let you know that that discussion is underway, at Talk:Christianity and Judaism#Overly speedy deletion, with a view to perhaps setting aside the AfD decision.  

Of course, some significant issues were raised in the AfD about the article in its present form, so the best way forward is a question that needs some thought.  Please feel welcome to come and participate!

 Problems with the new introduction 

First paragraph:
1. No one """"discovered"""" Ancient Egyptians: they have been known to their neighbors since the dawn of civilization. 
2. """"Everyone seems to enjoy"""" is not a phrase one should use in an encyclopedia article. 
3. Speculating on the reasons certain scholars are involved in this discussion is just a step away from an argumentum ad hominem.

Second paragraph:
The 'Eurocentrist' position (i.e. that Ancient Egypt was predominantly Caucasian) is still excluded, which makes the intro biased.

Third paragraph: 
""""it is very clear that this is not a question that will have an answer to for some time"""" is pure speculation (i.e. POV, i.e. original research: how did you come to this conclusion?)

====
The racial identity of ancient Egyptians has been steeped in controversy ever since the discovery of their existence. Everyone seems to enjoy the mysterious nature of the Ancient Egyptians and for many different reasons, be it for prosperity or to clear historical inaccuracies, want to claim them as their own. 

There are many different opinions on their racial makeup. One opinion among some scholars is that ancient Egypt was a multi-racial society. Another opinion held by other scholars is that that ancient Egyptians were black African peoples, claiming that this """"black identity"""" was strongest in early Egyptian history and waned over time. They also assert Egypt remained essentially a black African civilization throughout the dynastic era. Then we also have many other historians reluctant to make definitive claims about the skin color of its inhabitants. 

Although the mainstream position has changed over time,it is very clear that this is not a question that will have an answer to for some time.

The starting paragraph cited http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-indie-music-rights-agency-merlin-adds-tracks-to-p2p-network-imesh/ which states """"Lphant is now relaunched as a legal download P2P site but is still is still compatible with file-sharing networks such as BitTorrent"""" in an effort to phish users to download an application which uses the same name and elephant-like logo to the original one, but is neither created by the original author nor does it connect to BitTorrent.

Considering that no information has been published about the acquisition of the lphant application by anyone, the developments on the domain name are irrelevant to the article, aside from any information that will dissociate the original application to discordia's domains. In other words, Discordia's client does not have a place in this article. Neither does lphant.com anymore. As a result, there is no reason to link to lphant.com and especially not to shareaza.com which is attempted by certain users. Any links to shareaza.com especially under the name Shareaza are used to increase the page rank of the fake site on shareaza Google search queries.

Fortunately the original lphant.com site is still on the Internet Archive, so any request for citations about the original application will be satisfied.

This is a long term problem;   CT seems to have found a haven in WP where they feel they can claim and freely assert their """"authority"""" on the subject of local realism and experimental tests of Bell's inequalities. I fear the WP structure is much too weak to do anything about it. The typical wikipedian response seems to be """"Go to mediation"""" etc., etc. But the problem only shifts to someplace else.  14:17, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ok we seem to be having an edit war with people removing the Spirit Ranger info. 
1. They have appeared in the show already, and the new episode has aired on Jetix XD which elaboartes further that the Spirit Rangers are projections of the Masters Spirits (and the Masters are good)
2. An argument was made that they probably wouldn't be around after this story arc was over, well Cat Ranger and Nova Ranger only had one episode appearances and are listed as Rangers.
3. preview scans in Terebi Magazine show the Spirit Rangers fighting agains the Rinshi WITH the Rangers..so thye will be turning good, images of """"Red Korag"""" from the same magazine were used to illustrate that Koragg would be joining the Mystic Force Rangers long before he actually turned into Wolf Warrior, but we have to wait two weeks before I'm proven right and get to repost this information.

ff51ba94ededd0a3,"""==Questionable punishment of D*98==
The January 2010 block against User:Darryl98 was extremely harsh, IMHO, as being a 1-month block for a WP:3RR violation that was escalated by a more-experienced user who was well aware of goading people into a revert-war. Perhaps an 8-day block would have been more fair, with an attempt to discuss the situation during those 8 days, and possibly remove the block sooner than 8 days, after true consensus (that means a mutual agreement). Please understand that Wikipedia policies are actually much more fair, in writing, than the way some users (and admin users) misapply those policies: the typical block for WP:3RR is only a 24-hour block, not 1 month. In fact, per WP:Blocking_policy, use of excessive blocking is a violation due to the reasoning that new users will become highly irritated by excessive punishment. The idea of fair punishment isn't just a matter of human decency, or common sense when trying to actually """"collaborate"""" with other users, no, much more than those reasons, fair punishment is a stated policy issue. I think what needs to be added, to avoid excessive punishment, is to develop a type of """"Code of Hammurabi"""" as a list of wiki-punishments for each situation, based on length of tenure, total edit-count, and repeat-offenses, so that the punishment does NOT just become a matter of """"lengthen the block so a user won't come back soon to cause more trouble"""". Meanwhile, rather than reducing future conflicts, excessive punishment poisons the Internet community with unhappy users who spread the word of how they were mistreated. Typically, users will not see unfairness as a few admins crossing the line and violating policies in a harsh manner, instead, a user victim is likely to """"blame Wikipedia"""" for being a """"bad system"""" that harrasses and abuses people. What needs to be emphasized, in discussions during a shorter block, is that some (many?) users (admins) violate policies, but this is not condoned, it's just hard to enforce because a banned user can return using a social-networking site that has thousands of IP addresses and Wikipedia cannot easily stop them. Also, Wikipedia has very limited appeal processes, and so there is nothing, yet, as sophisticated as even the """"American notion of justice"""" in Wikipedia: there are no trials by jury of informed peers (chosen at random). Instead, many issues are decided by """"dog pile"""" groups, who collect around a common bias or mindset, as a sort of """"feeding frenzy"""" or hive mind that sees a negative remark as a veiled attack against the hive, and many members of the hive must sink into """"sting mode"""" to counter-attack a person who states angry remarks. Currently, Wikipedia likes people who are ultra-mild and don't claim any Bill of Rights but simply beg to belong with the others. Hence, people from democratic republics come to Wikipedia and might demand their rights under the law, without realizing it is the Law of the Old West: be as nice as possible to avoid getting shot by other users/admins who are toting wiki-guns. Only some people think users have any rights to fair treatment, despite current WP policies that even require actions to be fair within those regulations. Perhaps WP needs to teach """"fairness classes"""" to users who come from fascist countries or domineering parents: being fair and courteous is not a strong force of nature, but rather must be taught to users. - 
Wikid, I'm sure that you are well aware of why WP cannot tolerate the improper use of WP:Sockpuppets. Just as your socking as Wz777 had to be stopped, so did PilgrimRose's socking as Darryl98. But blocks are not regarded as punishment, they are regarded as protection of WP from those who, like yourself, are having difficulty working within the rules. The indef block of a sockpuppet is applied equally to all such.  come howl 
 If you read that user's larger prior talk-page revisions, you will see that the stated preference was to become named as """"Darryl98"""" so I am respecting that request. In changing names, that user was not aware of how people can be goaded into a WP:3RR excess of revisions, and that escalation seemed to be the most serious of the policy violations. It is not a violation to have multiple usernames on Wikipedia. Plus, as an occasional user, it seemed that Darryl98 had spent extensive time to read the policies about WP:Sockpuppetry and properly explained each issue as it applied in the situation: no clear violation of puppets, but rather just being accused of """"nefarious"""" intentions, which was noted as a violation of WP:AGF. Again, the largest disturbance was engaging in a WP:3RR violation, typically risking a 24-hour block, wh",0,0,0,0,0,0

7f23d7826d278517,"US States name game is a terrible example 

Due to the limited number of states, this game would be over almost as quickly as it started.  Why?  Consider:
Over 40% (21 out of 50) of states end in the letter 'A'.  Of the four states that start in 'A', three (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona) also end in 'A', and the fourth, Arkansas, would lead you to either South Carolina or South Dakota, both of which end in 'A', and thus you'd be stuck in an endless loop of 6 states from which you cannot escape.  This loop is almost completely unavoidable.  The example given in the article is already stuck in this loop.
Almost as many (18 states) start with a letter that no other state ends in.  So the only way these states would ever come up in gameplay is if you started with them.  Of these states, we also have the only state ending in a 'T' (Connecticut) and the only state ending in an 'H' (Utah).  Thus, you can add Hawaii, Tennessee, and Texas to the list of states that will almost never come up.
The only way you won't end up stuck in the endless 'A'-loop is if you somehow land on one of the five states (Delaware, New Hampshire, Tennessee (unlikely as seen above), Kentucky, and New Jersey) that end in a letter no other state starts with, at which point the game would be over.
There are numerous other pitfalls; consider Ohio.  You could either loop endlessly on Ohio, or go to Oklahoma, thus falling into the 'A'-loop, or you could go to Oregon.  From there you could go to Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, and North Dakota, all falling again into the 'A'-loop.  Or you could hit New Hampshire or New Jersey, both game enders, or New Mexico, which just takes you back where you started, or finally New York.  New York then leads to Kentucky (ending the game) or Kansas (falling via South Carolina or South Dakota back into the 'A'-loop yet again.)
Maybe Nations of the World would be a better example.  There's more of them for one thing, though still quite a few ending or starting in 'A' (and again a large number of which both start and end in 'A', so the loop still exists, but it's larger and easier to get out of).  Also, most letters of the alphabet are represented at the beginning or end of at least one country, so you'd be less likely to get stuck, and there aren't so many of them which could never appear.  (A few exist - can't think of any countries ending in 'J', 'V' or 'Z' - sorry Jordan, Vietnam, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, probably more but I'd have to do a more thorough search.)  Anyhow, maybe I'm crazy for noticing stuff like this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I understand what you mean, but there has been a misunderstanding (my fault for sure). I didn't call """"ignorant"""" in the same meaning of """"moron"""". A person with an IQ < 60 is hopeless; an ignorant can always learn. I explained that I attributed to """"ignorant"""" a very specific meaning, that of being unaware, not knowing. Which I don't see as an insult in itself: I am myself ignorant of an incredible amount of things (while, instead, I don't think to be a moron, while I know I can have poor judgement from time to time).

As for the controversy section, it's hard to expand because often what we have are the quotes - nothing more or less - and I can't really work them into to the main article for the same reasons as with the trivia section.

First, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as """"keep"""" regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).

As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia's verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren't produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form """"keep, I believe this subject is notable"""" are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speedy deletion of Alex mcdonald
 A tag has been placed on Alex mcdonald requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

Eleland

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

 Ward Churchill is Not An Indian 
I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"Eichmann's."""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Right so one user isn't allowed to share interests of another user ... you are way in over your head because what happens if there are some twins that register an account on here ... if they share similarities between each other (music), writing style etc. and one becomes a problem user but the other is the complete opposite you are then telling me that you will block the GOOD twin (from a Wikipedia point of view to spite the vandal twin) - now you have done that you have alienated this user from Wikipedia, and the better twin not only resents Wikipedia but they have also lost all faith in the encyclopedia and will NOT be recommending its services to his / her friends! Another scenario could be that a friend or relative has seen how the account user writes and has decided to hack into their account and perform some very inappropriate edits under that person's username ... meanwhile the owner of the account is completely oblivious to this and only when they log in or just take a look at their user talk page find that they have been either issued a warning (s) or have been BLOCKED for something they did NOT do as a result of the nastiness caused by the vandal (hacker), the person that has USED their account to create problems with other users and to ultimately get them in a lot of trouble with the Wikipedia Community.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I saw your protection request for South Asia, though another admin acted on it.  I thought I'd let you know a little more about the issue, as I'm pretty sure why Fastily declined it.  In general, semi-protection is used only when an article is regularly being vandalizedusually, regularly means no less than once every few days.  Looking at the history of South Asia, I see only about 1 vandalism edit per week, which is not enough to justify semi-protection.  In fact, in all of August, I only see one revert for vandalism; plus I see productive edits by unconfirmed editors.   There are exceptions that might cause a page to be protected with less negative activity, like when the edits aren't just vandalism but also defamatory to living people (per WP:BLP), but that doesn't apply here. I hope that helps explain why that page shouldn't be protected at this time.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Whoever wrote this has never been to Rosita.  While no longer incorporated, it can still be found on Google or Bing Maps.  There are dozens of homes there, and many more in the surrounding area, so it can hardly be called a ghost town.

 Don - This is classic - You wrote 10 pounds of stuff, took off in a tangent, and didn't even answer my question under discussion requiring no more than a simple yes/no objective response. Then you went ahead and reversed my deletion in the article without discussing it here. Please get consensus before making any article changes.
 I took a closer look at your source for the """"under 18"""" thing and found a few issues:
 1. It is a paid report costing $30 to access. How can any editor verify that you aren't making bogus claims? 
 2. This article seems to be referring to meditation in general and not Sahaj Marg, so it's not relevant to this discussion - You may want to place it in the meditation article.
 3. It is speaking of the inappropriateness of meditation from a pediatric standpoint (supposedly - I haven't read it). The wiki article on pediatrics says that this science is relevant to children up to 14 to 21 of age. So how is this specifically relevant to the """"18 years of age"""" point under discussion here? If you want to put in a criticism of Sahaj Marg making younger children meditate, don't hide it in an irrelevant footnote. 
 4. Finally, the sentence """"Sahaj Marg guru recommends a minimum age of 18 before beginning the practice of meditation, implying this technique is not suitable for younger people."""" is your extrapolation of the motivations for the SRCM rules, i.e. original research. Not admissible. I will be removing the """"implying this technique is not suitable for younger people"""" part.

Hi, it's mr.bonus. I know you have edited a previous post of mine to remove the uncivil chat between me and Kung Fu Man but it needs to be logged that his behaviour has been, at times, antagonistic. My first point (which you edited) was a bit OTT for a mediation case (which I made hastilly in retalliation) but there are some things that need to be said as Kung Fu Man has been treating this debate as in the same vain as a forum argument. I have written a little along these lines and I would appreciate it if you would leave it as it is. You'll find that the comments I made are not disparagaring and are simply there to make the point. My comments are justified, as a quick comparison between my and Kung Fu Man's replies will show how he frequently posts in an un-called for antagonistic manner.

Hello again. If you have some spare time, I was wondering if you could help out at one of the articles I have on my watch list, namely Contrat nouvelle embauche, I have been trying to help out myself in recent weeks, with mixed results, as there appear to be two main editors involved with very different opinions. Unfortunately, I'm reaching my limit of usefulness as many of the references used are in French, so I can do very little background reading myself. I was hoping that you might ideally suited to take a look, being legal minded (it's the new employment contract), have more french than me, and are diplomatic as the current discussion is getting a little heated again, based on what a french source does or does not say. (Of course, feel free to have a look and run away ) Regards,",0,0,0,0,0,0

fe175fb1ea6ad94a,"Hi Danimations, I have some suggestions.  Firstly, the inclusion of sections about “Role and origins” and “History” (or maybe “History and achievements”) would be helpful.  A possible source of information is the six annual reports for the Premier's Climate Change Council which can be downloaded from the DEWNR website.  Just paste “Premier's Climate Change Council’ into the search box on the home page.  Secondly, with respect to the “Membership” section, content explaining from what sectors of the community the members are sourced from should be added.  Also, the “dot point” lists should be converted into a paragraph of names in alphabetical order with the words “(chair)” after the person who currently has this responsibility.  I suggest this for two reasons - firstly, the ‘lists’ do dominate the article and secondly, as the article does not appear to be intended to be a list as per WP guidance.  I will have a look again early tomorrow morning.  Regards",0,0,0,0,0,0
